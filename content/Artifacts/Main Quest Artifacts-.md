These artifacts are central to **Lord Damaris' ascension**, the players’ attempts to stop him, and the overarching conflict. The players must interact with these artifacts at key points in the main story, as they directly relate to the villain's rise to power and the ultimate fate of **Vaeloris**.

1. **The Heart of the Void**
    - **Reason**: This artifact is crucial for **Lord Damaris** and his ability to manipulate shadow magic. It's heavily tied to the **Oppressors' strategy**, especially with **General Kaida Shadowsong**. The players will likely need to confront **Kaida** to prevent her from using it further.
    - **Main Quest Role**: Retrieving or destroying the **Heart of the Void** weakens **Kaida** and significantly limits **Damaris' powers** over shadow magic.
2. **The Scepter of Souls**
    - **Reason**: This artifact is integral to **Damaris' ascension**, as it allows him to steal the **life force** of his enemies and fuel his rise to godhood. This artifact will have to be dealt with in order to prevent **Damaris** from siphoning more power during the final stages of the campaign.
    - **Main Quest Role**: Players may have to face **General Seraphis Blackflame** in **Drakenport** to retrieve or destroy the **Scepter of Souls** before **Damaris** becomes nearly invincible.
3. **The Shattered Crown of Domination**
    - **Reason**: This artifact allows **Damaris** to control minds and command armies effortlessly. If the players don’t act, **Damaris** will gain overwhelming control over entire regions without a fight.
    - **Main Quest Role**: The players must decide whether to destroy the **Shattered Crown** or use it, potentially controlling factions or even members of the **Oppressors** for their cause. However, this artifact’s risk of driving the wielder mad introduces moral consequences.
4. **The Chain of Dominion**
    - **Reason**: This artifact ties into **Damaris' desire** to enslave and control all of **Vaeloris**. If he obtains it, he could **enslave the minds** of powerful NPCs and allies, turning them against the players.
    - **Main Quest Role**: Located in the **Prison of Forgotten Souls**, this will be a climactic point in **Ravenmoor**, and players will need to retrieve or destroy the **Chain** to prevent **Damaris** from gaining overwhelming control.
