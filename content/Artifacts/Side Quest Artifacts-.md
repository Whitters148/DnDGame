These artifacts are powerful but not essential to **Damaris' plan** or the main quest. Instead, they offer **significant bonuses** or **side challenges** that provide advantages for the players if they seek them out. They could be used to help the players face **Damaris' forces**, but each comes with its own curse or moral dilemma.

1. **The Mirror of Forgotten Truths**
    - **Reason**: This artifact provides glimpses into alternate realities and hidden truths, offering **valuable knowledge** to the players but at the cost of their mental stability.
    - **Side Quest Role**: While it could offer **critical information** that helps unravel the mystery of **Damaris’ power**, it’s not required to complete the main quest. Players may encounter this artifact during a side quest in **Gloomwatch**, unlocking **secrets of the past** that could aid in future quests.
2. **The Veil of Night**
    - **Reason**: This artifact would appeal to **Kaida Shadowsong** or any stealth-focused player. Its abilities would give the players a significant advantage in stealth-based encounters but aren’t essential to the main quest.
    - **Side Quest Role**: Located deep in **Darkwood Forest**, this is a perfect fit for a **side quest** where players may need to complete a **stealth-focused dungeon** or assassination mission. It could grant one player immense power in stealth, but at the cost of losing their connection to light.
3. **The Gauntlet of the Abyss**
    - **Reason**: A powerful melee artifact tied to **Varathor Bloodfury**, but not essential to **Damaris’ grand design**. It offers overwhelming strength to the player, but the risk of becoming a **mindless agent of destruction** fits well as a side choice.
    - **Side Quest Role**: A side dungeon in the **Iron Wastes**, where players face dangerous trials to obtain the **Gauntlet**. It could assist in battle, but its corruptive influence is high risk, possibly turning the wielder against their allies in battle.
4. **The Ember of Eternal Flame**
    - **Reason**: This artifact is sought by **General Seraphis Blackflame**, but it is not essential to **Damaris' ascension**. The artifact is more of a personal goal for **Seraphis** and ties into his subplot of creating a firestorm army.
    - **Side Quest Role**: Found in **The Wyrm’s Spine**, this could be a **side quest** tied to defeating or confronting **Seraphis Blackflame**. Its fiery abilities would help against **Damaris’ army**, but its curse of uncontrollable rage makes it a dangerous option.
5. **The Eye of the Storm**
    - **Reason**: This powerful elemental artifact could be extremely useful, but it’s not pivotal to **Damaris’ plans**. It gives the wielder control over natural disasters and elemental forces but is highly unstable.
    - **Side Quest Role**: A quest in the **Frozen North** would involve facing the elemental spirits guarding this artifact. If the players choose to seek it, they gain immense weather control, but using it too much could bring **chaos** across the land, inadvertently harming allies or neutral regions.
6. **The Hourglass of Fate**
    - **Reason**: While it’s powerful, the **Hourglass** is not crucial to **Damaris' ascension**, though it could offer a unique perspective on manipulating time.
    - **Side Quest Role**: A side quest in the **Temple of Lost Time** deep within **Darkwood Forest**. The players can choose to interact with the **Hourglass**, possibly rewinding events or gaining foreknowledge, but they risk losing their memories or identity in the process.
