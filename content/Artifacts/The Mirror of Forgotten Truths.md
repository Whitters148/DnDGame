### **Description**:

The **Mirror of Forgotten Truths** is an ancient artifact that reflects not just the present but also the past and possible futures. Crafted in the lost era before the Abyssal Gate was sealed, it holds power that mortals often cannot bear. The Mirror's surface seems to ripple, distorting reality, and reveals truths that have been hidden or forgotten.

Those who dare look into the Mirror are granted unparalleled knowledge, but at the cost of their sanity. Many who have gazed upon it have succumbed to madness, unable to cope with the revelations it shows. The Mirror offers great power, but its knowledge is both a blessing and a curse.

### **Special Abilities**:

1. **Revelation of Secrets** (1/day):
    
    When the Mirror is used, the wielder can ask one question about the past, present, or future, and the Mirror will reveal the truth. The wielder must make a **DC 18 Intelligence saving throw** after each use or suffer a **-1 penalty to their Intelligence score** as they struggle to comprehend the overwhelming knowledge revealed.
    
2. **Memory Alteration** (3/day):
    
    The wielder can manipulate the memories of a creature they can see within 60 feet. The target must make a **DC 16 Wisdom saving throw** or have their memories altered, forgetting a specific event or recalling a different version of it. The altered memory lasts for 24 hours unless dispelled by magic or the target succeeds on a **DC 18 Intelligence check** upon realizing the inconsistency.
    
3. **Truth in Shadows** (2/day):
    
    The Mirror can pierce illusions and invisibility, allowing the wielder to see the true form of creatures or objects within a 30-foot radius for 1 hour. During this time, the wielder has **advantage on Investigation checks** to detect hidden or disguised entities.
    
4. **Visions of Fate** (1/week):
    
    The Mirror grants the wielder a brief glimpse into the future. For the next hour, the wielder has **advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks**. However, after the vision fades, they must succeed on a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw** or suffer from **exhaustion** (level 1).

### **Cursed Nature**:

The **Mirror of Forgotten Truths** carries a dangerous curse that affects all who attune to it.

- **Madness of Knowledge**: Each time the Mirror is used to reveal a truth, there is a 10% chance the wielder will suffer from long-term madness. Roll a **d100** after each use; on a roll of **10 or lower**, the wielder suffers from **long-term madness**, which lasts for **1d10 x 10 hours**. The DM can roll on the Long-Term Madness table in the _Dungeon Master’s Guide_ to determine the specific effect.
    
    Examples include:
    
    - Compelled to repeat an action (such as prayer or counting) over and over.
    - Experiencing extreme paranoia, imposing **disadvantage** on all rolls.
    - Incapacitated, believing they are trapped in an illusion.
    - Suffers from amnesia and cannot recall events from the past 24 hours.
    
    These effects can be cured with a **Greater Restoration** spell.
    
- **Fragmented Reality**: Each time the wielder uses the Mirror’s **Memory Alteration** ability, there is a cumulative 5% chance (starting at 5%, increasing by 5% with each use) that they will begin to question their own memories. After failing a **DC 17 Wisdom saving throw**, the wielder may start forgetting details from their past or misremembering key events (determined by the DM). This condition imposes disadvantage on **History** and **Insight** checks until cured by a **Greater Restoration** spell or similar magic.

### **Backstory**:

Forged long ago by a forgotten order of seers, the **Mirror of Forgotten Truths** was said to contain the knowledge of all that has ever been or ever will be. It was hidden away to protect the world from its dangerous power, but as time passed, its location was lost to myth. Now, the Mirror is guarded by **Seraphina Blackthorn** within the Abyssal Gate. She too has glimpsed into the Mirror’s depths, and though she survived, it has left its mark on her.

### **Value in the World**:

The Mirror is a coveted relic, desired by those who seek to uncover ancient secrets or gain an edge in the war against Damaris. However, its curse has made many wary of claiming it, as it can easily lead to madness or worse. **Scholars, mages, and rulers** are drawn to the Mirror’s allure, but few understand the full cost of its knowledge.
