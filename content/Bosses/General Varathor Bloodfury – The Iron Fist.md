### **Appearance** (Deceased):

Varathor Bloodfury was an imposing half-orc, towering over seven feet tall, with a frame that resembled a living fortress. His greenish-gray skin bore the marks of countless battles, and his red eyes once glowed with a simmering rage. He wore spiked black iron armor, forged from the mines of the Iron Wastes and stained with the blood of his enemies. His most notable feature had been his magically enhanced right arm, pulsating with dark energy until his death. Varathor’s weapon of choice, a massive battle-axe named **Rend**, cleaved through both armor and magic alike, though now it lies silent with its master.

### **Backstory**:

Varathor Bloodfury was born into a nomadic tribe of orcs, where he quickly rose to become warlord through his raw strength and tactical prowess. His ambitions led him to align with **Lord Damaris Malakar**, swearing fealty to the dark lord in exchange for power and a chance to dominate. He became one of the most feared generals of the Oppressors, leading their armies to victory time and time again. However, his thirst for conquest and glory would ultimately lead to his downfall in a climactic battle, where he met his end at the hands of the Resistance, shattering the backbone of the Oppressors' military might.
