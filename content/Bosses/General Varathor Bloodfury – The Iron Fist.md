### **Appearance**:

Varathor Bloodfury is an imposing half-orc, standing over seven feet tall and built like a living fortress. His greenish-gray skin is covered in scars from countless battles, each one a testament to his ferocity on the battlefield. His red eyes glow with a constant, simmering rage, and his hulking form is accentuated by his spiked black iron armor. The armor itself is made from the iron extracted from the mines of the Iron Wastes, heavily reinforced and marked with the blood of his enemies. His most notable feature is his magically enhanced right arm, larger and far more powerful than his left, which pulses with dark energy.

He wields a massive, jagged battle-axe named **Rend**, a weapon that seems to thirst for blood and is known to cleave through both armor and magic alike. His tusks protrude from a face that is perpetually set in a grimace of disdain or rage. Tattoos of battle glyphs and runes cover his body, adding both to his combat prowess and to the intimidation he exudes on the battlefield.

### **Backstory**:

Born into a nomadic tribe of orcs, Varathor Bloodfury always stood out for his natural strength and strategic mind. He rose through the ranks of his tribe, becoming their warlord at a young age by leading them to countless victories against rival clans and kingdoms. However, it wasn’t enough for him. He believed that his tribe, though powerful, lacked the vision to conquer and hold real power.

When Lord Damaris Malakar came to the Iron Wastes, Varathor was initially skeptical of this charismatic human. But when he witnessed the raw power Damaris wielded and his plans to reshape the world, Varathor saw the opportunity to realize his own dreams of domination. He swore fealty to Damaris, becoming the brutal enforcer of the Oppressors and commanding their vast armies. His tactical genius on the battlefield is matched only by his thirst for violence.

### **Faction: The Oppressors**:

As one of Lord Damaris' most trusted generals, Varathor leads the majority of the Oppressors’ armies into direct combat. His forces are made up of brutal warriors, siege engines, and monstrous creatures that crush opposition with overwhelming force. He commands battalions in key territories such as **The Iron Wastes** and **Duneblade Desert**, ensuring these regions remain under Oppressor control.

### **Symbolism & Themes**:

- **Tactical Weakness**: Though Varathor is a brilliant general, his reliance on brute force and straightforward attacks may provide players with an opportunity to exploit his overconfidence or lack of subtlety in certain situations.
- **Redemption Arc**: Varathor’s loyalty is rooted in power. Should the players manage to demonstrate superior strength or expose a weakness in Damaris’ leadership, they may be able to sway him—or at least fracture his loyalty to the Oppressor cause.
