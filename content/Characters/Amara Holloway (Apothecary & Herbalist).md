- **Role**: Merchant / Quest Giver
- **Appearance**: A middle-aged woman with graying hair tied back in a loose bun. Her face is lined with age and worry, but her eyes are sharp and discerning. She wears a stained apron over simple, dark clothing, and her hands are always busy mixing potions or sorting herbs.
- **Personality**: Amara is practical and pragmatic, with little patience for superstition or nonsense. She is fiercely protective of her small shop and those she cares about.
- **Background**: Amara is one of the few residents of Gloomwatch who believes in fighting back against the curse and not just surviving it. She uses her knowledge of herbs and potions to aid the villagers, though her supplies are often limited.
- **Role in the Story**: Amara sells potions, herbs, and magical supplies. She may offer quests to gather rare ingredients from dangerous parts of Ravenmoor or to create a special potion to aid the players in their journey.
