### **Appearance**:

Boris is a stout, aging dwarf with a long, unkempt gray beard that is often tangled in knots. A pair of thick spectacles rests on his nose, constantly slipping as he moves about in his shop. His apron, stained with mysterious, colorful blotches, reveals the chaotic nature of his potion experiments. His fingers are calloused from years of handling hot cauldrons and delicate vials, and his thick eyebrows twitch in concentration whenever he's working on a particularly tricky brew.

### **Personality**:

Boris is enthusiastic, scatterbrained, and always bubbling with excitement for his next experiment. Though many of his creations have had unintended side effects, his heart is always in the right place. His nickname, “Bumbling,” comes from his frequent mistakes in the lab, but despite his clumsiness, Boris remains one of the most skilled potion vendors in Gloomwatch. His optimistic outlook and love of discovery often lead to chaos, but he believes that even failure is a part of progress. He is fiercely protective of his friends, especially his business partner and wife, Thalia Whisperwind

### **Backstory**:

Once a highly skilled alchemist, Boris spent his early years traveling and learning the craft of potion-making from master alchemists across the lands. However, his natural curiosity and love for experimentation often led to explosions, odd mutations, and the occasional bout of temporary blindness for his clients. After one particularly infamous mishap where he accidentally turned a town’s water supply into a healing potion (which caused strange side effects), he earned the nickname "Bumbling."

Despite his reputation, Boris decided to settle in **Gloomwatch**, where he set up shop with **[[Thalia Whisperwind (Spell Vendor)|Thalia]]** at **[[Blackbrew & Whisperwind's Arcane Emporium]]**. There, his experiments continue, and though his potions are highly effective, they sometimes come with unexpected results.

### **Role in the Story**:

Boris provides potions, tonics, and elixirs to the players, offering both standard healing brews and more experimental concoctions. While his potions are often potent, there’s always a small risk of side effects, making Boris both a useful ally and a potential source of comedic chaos. Players may find themselves working with Boris on a quest to gather rare ingredients or testing out one of his latest inventions—sometimes with unexpected consequences.

### **Traits**:

- **Potion Mastery**: Boris’s potions are highly effective but may have unintended side effects. Players who purchase his potions must roll a d20 after consuming one; on a 1-2, the potion has a minor adverse effect (such as temporary dizziness or a change in skin color).
- **Experimental Brew**: Boris can brew potions that provide random, temporary effects. Roll on a random effect table to see what benefit or drawback the player gains.
- **Alchemical Knowledge**: Boris has advantage on checks related to identifying potions, elixirs, and other magical concoctions.
