- **Role**: Main Story / Quest Giver
- **Appearance**: A hunched, frail old man with a long, wispy beard and piercing, almost luminous eyes. He wears a tattered, hooded robe and carries a staff made from gnarled wood, adorned with hanging charms of bone and stone.
- **Personality**: Wise but cryptic, Mordwyn speaks in riddles and often seems disconnected from the present moment. He is deeply attuned to the village's mystical energies and the spirits that haunt it.
- **Background**: As the oldest living resident, he has witnessed the decline of Gloomwatch firsthand. He bears the weight of the village's suffering and is desperate to see its curse lifted.
- **Role in the Story**: Elder Mordwyn can provide the players with vital information about the village's history, the nature of the curse, and clues to the artifact they seek. He may also offer quests related to placating the restless spirits or finding lost relics of the villageâ€™s past.
