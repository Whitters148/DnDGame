### **Appearance**:

Gregor is a burly man with a hunched posture, the result of years spent digging graves and working in the shadows of the cemetery. His hands are permanently stained by dirt, a sign of his long-standing profession. His short, messy brown hair is often unkempt, and his pale skin speaks to the many years he has spent outdoors, but always under the cover of gloom. His dark, sunken eyes give him a haunted, weary appearance, as if he has seen far too much for one lifetime.

### **Personality**:

Blunt and morbidly humorous, Gregor has a habit of cracking jokes about death and the grave, finding humor in the macabre. Despite the dark nature of his profession, he is a steady and reliable presence in **Gloomwatch**. His calm demeanor makes him well-suited to the eerie atmosphere of the village, and he rarely seems fazed by the supernatural occurrences around him. While some may find his humor unsettling, Gregor’s grounded nature offers comfort to those who may otherwise be overwhelmed by the ever-present sense of death in the village.

### **Backstory**:

Gregor has been the gravedigger of **Gloomwatch** since he was a young boy, learning the trade from his father, who held the same position before him. Growing up in the cemetery, Gregor has always been surrounded by death and the mysteries of the grave. He has witnessed strange occurrences over the years, from wandering spirits to unexplainable phenomena, but he has learned to take it all in stride. His long years of service to the village have made him a fixture of **Gloomwatch**, and despite his dark sense of humor, Gregor is deeply respected for his reliability and work ethic.

While he doesn’t dabble in the supernatural, Gregor’s experience with the dead makes him a valuable ally to those dealing with matters of life and death in **Ravenmoor**. He knows the history of the graveyard and the secrets it holds, and though he may be reluctant to share, he is always willing to lend a hand when the village is in danger.
