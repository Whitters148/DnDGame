- **Role**: Side Quest Giver
- **Appearance**: A burly, somber man with a lined face and a permanent scowl. His clothes are perpetually stained with dirt, and he carries a spade slung over his shoulder. His eyes are sunken, and his voice is gravelly and low.
- **Personality**: Gregor is gruff and prefers solitude. He is deeply superstitious and haunted by the things he’s seen while digging graves in a cursed village.
- **Background**: Gregor comes from a long line of gravediggers in Gloomwatch and feels it’s his duty to stay, even as others flee. He knows the village’s graveyards and crypts better than anyone.
- **Role in the Story**: Gregor may ask players to help him re-bury disturbed graves or investigate strange occurrences in the cemetery. His knowledge of the underground tunnels and crypts could be crucial for navigating the village’s darker places.
