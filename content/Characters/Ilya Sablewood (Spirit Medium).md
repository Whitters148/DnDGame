### **Appearance**:

Ilya is a slight, ethereal woman with long, silver hair that flows like a river of moonlight. Her pale skin gives her an almost spectral appearance, and her eyes glow faintly, as if she is always in tune with the spirit world. She dresses in flowing robes covered in ancient runes, each symbol enhancing her connection to the dead. Her voice is soft and distant, and when she speaks, it often feels as though she is only half-present, always partially listening to the voices of spirits around her.

---

### **Personality**:

Ilya is calm, serene, and deeply attuned to the spirit world. While she is compassionate and empathetic toward those who seek her help, she often appears detached from the living, preferring the company of spirits to that of people. This distance makes her seem aloof, though she is always willing to assist those in need. Ilya is known for her wisdom, but her connection to the dead has left her with an unconventional view of life, and she frequently sees events through the lens of the spiritual realm, making her unpredictable in her reactions and advice.

### **Backstory**:

From a young age, Ilya exhibited an unusual gift—the ability to communicate with spirits. This ability was both a blessing and a curse, as it isolated her from others but also gave her the tools to help those dealing with the loss of loved ones. Over the years, she honed this gift, becoming a spirit medium who resides on the outskirts of **Gloomwatch**. Villagers come to her seeking answers from beyond the grave, hoping to connect with lost loved ones or to protect themselves from the undead that plague **Ravenmoor**. Ilya’s bond with the spirit world has grown so strong that she can sense disturbances in the supernatural fabric of the village, and though she is distant from the living, she is respected for her knowledge of the dead.

### **Role in the Story**:

Ilya provides guidance to the players, particularly when dealing with supernatural forces, ghosts, and undead. Her unique ability to communicate with spirits makes her an invaluable resource for uncovering hidden knowledge, learning ancient secrets, or navigating dangerous areas haunted by restless souls. While she may seem detached, her insights could be the key to solving some of **Gloomwatch’s** most unsettling mysteries.

### **Traits**:

- **Spirit Sight**: Ilya can see and communicate with spirits, giving her insight into events that are invisible to the living. She can provide information about restless spirits, hauntings, or curses affecting the village.
- **Otherworldly Calm**: Ilya has advantage on saving throws against fear effects and cannot be frightened by undead creatures due to her constant interaction with the spirit world.
- **Spiritual Guidance**: Once per day, Ilya can call upon the spirits to assist the players, granting them advantage on a Wisdom (Insight) check or revealing hidden information.
