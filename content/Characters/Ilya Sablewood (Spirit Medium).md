- **Role**: Side Quest Giver
- **Appearance**: A slender, almost translucent-looking woman with ash-blonde hair and a perpetually haunted expression. She wears simple, tattered robes and a veil that obscures most of her face. Her eyes are milky white, as if she is in a constant state of trance.
- **Personality**: Ilya is quiet and soft-spoken, often appearing distracted as if listening to voices no one else can hear. She is gentle but aloof, as if part of her is not entirely in the physical world.
- **Background**: Ilya has the ability to communicate with the spirits that linger in Gloomwatch, and she often serves as a mediator between the living and the dead. Her gift, however, comes at the cost of her own sanity, and she is sometimes unsure of what is real and what is not.
- **Role in the Story**: Ilya may ask players to help her put tormented spirits to rest or investigate why certain spirits have become malevolent. She could also serve as a guide to the players in navigating the villageâ€™s supernatural aspects.
