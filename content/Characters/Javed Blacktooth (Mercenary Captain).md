- **Role**: Leader of the local mercenaries.
- **Occupation**: Mercenary for hire.
- **Personality**: Gruff, opportunistic, and more interested in coin than causes. However, he has a sense of loyalty to those who prove themselves.
- **How to Utilize**:
    - **Hireable Help**: Javed and his mercenaries can be hired to assist the players in certain missions, or the players may need to convince him to join the Resistance. However, Javed’s loyalty is easily swayed by gold, and he might side with the highest bidder.
    - **Side Quests**: Javed can offer combat-heavy quests, such as eliminating rival mercenaries or protecting a convoy.
    - **Interaction**: Javed can be found **drinking at The Scorched Oasis**, where he holds court with his band of mercenaries. He’s open to business, but he’ll need convincing before risking his life for a cause.
- **Appearance**:
    - **Age**: 42 years old, human male.
    - **Build**: Broad-shouldered and tall, with a powerful, intimidating build, marked by battle scars.
    - **Skin**: Dark, weather-beaten skin, the result of many years spent on battlefields and under the desert sun.
    - **Hair**: His head is shaved bald, though his jawline is covered by a thick, dark beard streaked with gray. His beard is braided in several places.
    - **Clothing**: Wears worn leather armor reinforced with metal plates, clearly having seen many battles. A long black cape hangs from his shoulders, tattered at the edges. He has an eye patch covering his left eye, and several scars running across his face.
    - **Features**: His one good eye is a sharp, intense dark brown, always scanning his surroundings for threats. His mouth is often set in a grim line, and when he smiles, his gold tooth gleams. His arms are muscular and covered with crude tattoos representing various battles or victories. He carries a massive two-handed sword strapped to his back.
