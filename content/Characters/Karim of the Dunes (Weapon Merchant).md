- **Appearance**:
    - **Age**: 45 years old, human male.
    - **Build**: Broad and muscular, with the thick arms of a blacksmith and a solid frame that looks built for combat as much as trade.

    - **Hair**: Short-cropped and graying at the temples. He has a full, bushy beard, streaked with white.
    - **Clothing**: Wears a sleeveless leather vest, exposing his muscular arms, and rough linen trousers. Around his waist is a heavy belt from which various tools and weapons hang. His boots are worn, but well-crafted. He also has several iron bangles on his wrists, which jangle when he moves.
    - **Features**: Karim has a square jaw and a nose that looks like itâ€™s been broken more than once. His eyes are dark and hard, often narrowing in suspicion or assessment. His right arm has several tattoos of weapons and symbols representing his trade. His hands are rough and calloused from years of forging weapons.
