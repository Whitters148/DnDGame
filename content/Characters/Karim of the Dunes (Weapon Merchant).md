- **Role**: Weaponsmith and black market arms dealer.
- **Occupation**: Weapon merchant with ties to the desert nomads.
- **Personality**: Blunt, direct, and occasionally cynical, but he has a grudging respect for fighters who know what they want.
- **How to Utilize**:
    - **Supplier of Weapons**: Karim is one of the few merchants still operating in the region, and he sells weapons to both sides of the conflict. Players can buy or trade for rare weapons or upgrades, especially if they gain his trust.
    - **Black Market Contact**: If the players want to access the black market for specialized or illegal gear, Karim is the go-to contact. He can also offer secret side quests to acquire rare resources or weapons.
    - **Interaction**: His **shop is in the market**, with weapons displayed for sale, though his more rare and powerful items are hidden away for trusted customers
- **Appearance**:
    - **Age**: 45 years old, human male.
    - **Build**: Broad and muscular, with the thick arms of a blacksmith and a solid frame that looks built for combat as much as trade.
    - **Skin**: Light brown, with a leathery texture from the harsh desert sun.
    - **Hair**: Short-cropped and graying at the temples. He has a full, bushy beard, streaked with white.
    - **Clothing**: Wears a sleeveless leather vest, exposing his muscular arms, and rough linen trousers. Around his waist is a heavy belt from which various tools and weapons hang. His boots are worn, but well-crafted. He also has several iron bangles on his wrists, which jangle when he moves.
    - **Features**: Karim has a square jaw and a nose that looks like itâ€™s been broken more than once. His eyes are dark and hard, often narrowing in suspicion or assessment. His right arm has several tattoos of weapons and symbols representing his trade. His hands are rough and calloused from years of forging weapons.
