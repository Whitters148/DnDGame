### **Appearance**:

Karim is a broad, muscular man with thick arms that speak of years spent at the forge. His light brown skin has a leathery texture, hardened from the harsh desert sun, and his short-cropped hair is beginning to gray at the temples. His full, bushy beard is streaked with white, giving him a rugged, weathered appearance. Karim typically wears a sleeveless leather vest, which exposes his muscular arms, and rough linen trousers. A heavy belt hangs around his waist, from which several tools and weapons dangle. His worn but well-crafted boots have seen countless miles, and several iron bangles jangle on his wrists as he moves. His square jaw and crooked nose, which looks like it's been broken more than once, add to his tough demeanor. His dark eyes narrow often in suspicion or assessment, and tattoos of weapons and symbols cover his right arm, representing his trade.

### **Personality**:

Karim is blunt, direct, and occasionally cynical. He has little patience for small talk, preferring to get straight to the point. Despite his gruff exterior, he has a grudging respect for fighters who know what they want and are willing to get their hands dirty. His time as a weapons merchant has left him with a pragmatic view of the world, believing that survival often comes down to who has the sharpest sword. While he may be rough around the edges, Karim is loyal to those he trusts and doesn’t hesitate to forge alliances when it benefits both parties.

### **Backstory**:

Karim was born into a family of traders who roamed the desert, bartering goods with nomads and city folk alike. From a young age, he learned the value of weapons and how to make them. After gaining a reputation as a skilled blacksmith, Karim expanded into the black market, selling rare and powerful weapons to the highest bidder. His connections to the desert nomads gave him access to resources others couldn’t obtain, and his business flourished. However, when **Sunscar** fell, Karim was forced to flee, leaving much of his trade behind. Now relocated to **Falconstone**, he has set up a small forge where he helps the **Resistance** by supplying them with weapons and tools, salvaging what materials he can from the ruined city.

### **Role in the Story**:

Karim serves as both a weapons merchant and a black market contact for the players. Before the fall of **Sunscar**, players can approach him to buy or trade for rare weapons, or seek out his black market connections to acquire specialized or illegal gear. After moving to **Falconstone**, Karim transitions to forging weapons for the **Resistance** and the refugees, offering quests that involve gathering rare materials, salvaging abandoned Sunscar supplies, or helping craft specialized equipment. His expertise makes him a valuable ally in the fight against the **Oppressors**, though his cynical outlook can make him difficult to deal with.
