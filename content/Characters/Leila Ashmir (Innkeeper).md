- **Role**: Innkeeper of **The Scorched Oasis** Tavern.
- **Occupation**: Innkeeper, contact for the Resistance.
- **Personality**: Witty, sharp, and always aware of the latest gossip and happenings in town.
- **How to Utilize**:
    - **Quest Giver**: Leila knows much more than she lets on, and is often the players’ first contact within the **Resistance**. She can offer side quests or relay important information about key Resistance movements.
    - **Information Source**: Players can approach her to get rumors about enemy troop movements, hidden caches, and secret locations. She’s well-connected, and her inn serves as a neutral ground for both Resistance fighters and mercenaries.
    - **Interaction**: Players will typically find her in the tavern, where she’s busy managing the day-to-day operations, but always has an ear for useful information. They can also catch her after hours in the backroom for more secretive dealings.
- **Appearance**:
    - **Age**: 38 years old, human female.
    - **Build**: Tall and lean, with a graceful, agile frame.
    - **Skin**: Olive-toned, with a few visible scars along her arms and neck—souvenirs from her time as an adventurer before becoming an innkeeper.
    - **Hair**: Long, jet black, often tied back into a simple ponytail to keep it out of the way while working.
    - **Clothing**: Wears simple but well-kept tunics, usually in earthy tones of brown or green. A leather apron hangs over her front, marked with the stains of her work. She also wears small silver hoop earrings.
    - **Features**: Leila has high cheekbones, a straight nose, and dark, intelligent eyes that flicker with a knowing gleam. She carries herself with confidence, but there’s a quiet alertness to her posture, as if she’s always expecting trouble. Her hands are calloused from years of manual work at the inn.
