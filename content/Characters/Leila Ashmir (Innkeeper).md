    - **Build**: Tall and lean, with a graceful, agile frame.
    - **Skin**: Olive-toned, with a few visible scars along her arms and neck—souvenirs from her time as an adventurer before becoming an innkeeper.
    - **Hair**: Long, jet black, often tied back into a simple ponytail to keep it out of the way while working.
    - **Clothing**: Wears simple but well-kept tunics, usually in earthy tones of brown or green. A leather apron hangs over her front, marked with the stains of her work. She also wears small silver hoop earrings.
    - **Features**: Leila has high cheekbones, a straight nose, and dark, intelligent eyes that flicker with a knowing gleam. She carries herself with confidence, but there’s a quiet alertness to her posture, as if she’s always expecting trouble. Her hands are calloused from years of manual work at the inn.
