### **Appearance**:

Leila is a tall, lean woman with olive-toned skin that bears a few visible scars along her arms and neck—reminders of her past life as an adventurer. Her long, jet-black hair is usually tied back into a simple ponytail to keep it out of the way while she works. She has dark, intelligent eyes that flicker with a knowing gleam, often giving the impression that she’s two steps ahead of any conversation. Leila’s high cheekbones and straight nose add to her graceful, yet hardened, appearance. Her clothing is practical, usually consisting of simple tunics in earthy tones of brown or green, with a leather apron marked by the stains of her work.

### **Personality**:

Leila is witty, sharp, and always aware of the latest gossip and happenings in town. Despite her past as an adventurer, she now takes on a quieter, more calculated role within the Resistance, offering information, shelter, and support to those who need it. She has a quick wit and a sharp tongue, but she remains calm under pressure, preferring to deal with problems diplomatically before resorting to force. Leila has a quiet confidence, though she’s always on alert, scanning her surroundings with the caution of someone who has seen danger firsthand.

### **Backstory**:

Once a scout for a mercenary group, Leila’s sharp mind and quick reflexes made her invaluable in gathering intelligence and carrying out ambushes. However, after a mission gone wrong resulted in the deaths of several close companions, Leila decided to leave the dangerous life behind. She settled in **Sunscar**, opening **The Scorched Oasis** Tavern. Despite her desire for peace, her past continued to follow her, and she became a key contact for the **Resistance**, using her inn as a safe haven for secret dealings.

After the fall of **Sunscar**, Leila relocated to **Falconstone**, where she now cares for the displaced survivors. She runs a makeshift inn in the new settlement, providing shelter, food, and comfort to refugees while gathering intelligence about the surrounding threats. Though burdened by the responsibility of protecting her people, Leila remains a strong, comforting presence in the camp.
