### **Appearance**:

Nyra is a slim, athletic half-elf with a wiry, agile frame. Her pale skin has a slight olive undertone, giving her an ethereal appearance that suits her shadowy lifestyle. Her long, straight hair is as white as snow, usually tied back into a loose braid to keep it out of her face during missions. Nyra's attire consists of tight-fitting dark leather armor, designed for stealth and reinforced with light padding for protection. She always carries a hooded cloak for extra concealment and keeps a variety of daggers and small tools hidden in her boots and belt. Her sharp, angular features reflect her elven heritage, and her piercing violet eyes seem to miss nothing. Despite her calm and unreadable expression, her lips often carry a knowing smirk, hinting at her superior knowledge of the world around her.

### **Personality**:

Nyra is quiet, calculating, and always two steps ahead of those around her. She works in the shadows, rarely revealing her true motives or intentions. A skilled information broker and spy, Nyra trusts few people and operates with a detached efficiency. Her demeanor is calm and collected, and she prefers to let others reveal their cards before showing her hand. Despite her guarded nature, she holds a grudging respect for those who prove themselves capable in combat or in handling delicate situations. Nyra's calculating nature ensures she is always gathering intelligence, waiting for the right moment to strike or offer her services.

### **Backstory**:

Nyra was born to a nomadic group of half-elves who roamed the desert lands of **Sunscar**. From a young age, she displayed a talent for stealth and subterfuge, skills that quickly gained her a place within the Resistance as a covert operative. As a master thief and spy, Nyra specialized in gathering intelligence, stealing valuable information, and executing sabotage missions. Her ties to both the nomads and the underground networks of **Sunscar** made her invaluable to the Resistance, especially in subverting **Lord Damaris’** plans. However, the fall of **Sunscar** weighed heavily on Nyra, and she now finds herself in **Falconstone**, where she continues her covert work, scouting enemy forces and planning subversive operations against Damaris' generals.

After moving to **Falconstone**, Nyra remains a critical asset to the Resistance, scouting enemy movements and planning ambushes. Players can approach her for sensitive information or specialized quests, but they must prove themselves worthy of her trust before she shares her intelligence freely.
