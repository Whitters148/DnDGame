- **Role**: Master thief and covert operative for the Resistance.
- **Occupation**: Spy and information broker.
- **Personality**: Quiet, calculating, and always two steps ahead. She works in the shadows and rarely reveals her true motives.
- **How to Utilize**:
    - **Quest Giver**: Nyra can provide covert missions that require stealth, infiltration, or sabotage. She has knowledge of Varathor’s inner workings and often provides the Resistance with critical information about enemy plans.
    - **Information Source**: Nyra specializes in gathering intelligence on the Oppressors. Players can go to her for sensitive information, but they must prove their worth before she trusts them fully.
    - **Interaction**: Nyra is elusive and only appears when needed. Players can arrange meetings through intermediaries or seek her out in **hidden locations** around town.
- **Appearance**:
    - **Age**: 29 years old, half-elf female.
    - **Build**: Slim, athletic, and incredibly light on her feet. Her frame is wiry and agile.
    - **Skin**: Pale with a slight olive undertone, giving her an almost ethereal appearance.
    - **Hair**: Long, straight, and white as snow, often tied back in a loose braid to keep it out of her face during missions.
    - **Clothing**: Wears tight-fitting dark leather armor, designed for stealth. Her outfit is reinforced with light padding for protection, but it’s clearly made to allow silent movement. She keeps a hooded cloak on hand for extra concealment and carries a variety of daggers and small tools hidden in her boots and belt.
    - **Features**: Nyra has sharp, angular features typical of her elven heritage, with slightly pointed ears. Her piercing violet eyes seem to see everything and everyone, though her expression remains calm and unreadable. Her lips are often curved in a knowing smirk, and her hands move quickly when handling tools or weapons.
