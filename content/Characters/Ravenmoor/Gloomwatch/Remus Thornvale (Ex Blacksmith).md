### **Basic Information**

- **Name**: Remus Thornvale
- **Race**: Human
- **Class**: Commoner (Former Blacksmith)
- **Age**: 68
- **Alignment**: Neutral

### **Appearance**

Remus is a tall, broad-shouldered man with a strong, muscular build that belies his age, a testament to his many years working the forge. His skin is weathered and tanned, marked by countless burns and scars from his days as a blacksmith. His hair, once a thick, jet-black mane, is now sparse and silvery, framing a face etched with deep lines of worry and sorrow. His eyes are a faded blue, clouded by age and hardship, yet still possessing a sharp, analytical gaze. He often wears a simple, sturdy tunic and trousers, the rough fabric covered in soot stains from his former work, and a heavy leather apron, more out of habit than necessity.

### **Backstory**

Remus was once a renowned blacksmith in Sunscar, known for crafting some of the finest weapons and tools in the region. He took pride in his craft and found joy in shaping metal into objects of beauty and utility. However, as Sunscar fell into the hands of ruthless warlords and corrupt officials, the town he once loved changed beyond recognition. Bandits and mercenaries seized control, and the forge that had once been a symbol of strength and community became a tool of oppression, forced to produce weapons for those who would use them to terrorize the people.

Seeing the town he had helped build and protect turned into a den of violence and despair broke Remus’ heart. He tried to resist, sabotaging weapons and offering aid to the downtrodden, but his efforts were in vain. With every passing year, his disillusionment grew, and he became a shadow of his former self, a grizzled old man, longing for escape but trapped by his own poverty.

After many years of scraping and saving, Remus finally gathered enough coin to leave Sunscar behind. His destination: Ravenmoor, a land as dark and grim as the despair he feels, yet a place where he believes he can start anew. Perhaps in the mist-covered forests and haunted valleys, he can find peace or at least a place where he can live out his remaining years without the stifling oppression that suffocated Sunscar.

### **Personality**

Remus is a bitter, cynical man, hardened by loss and betrayal. He carries a deep-seated hatred for Sunscar and what it has become, but this anger is tempered by a profound sadness for the town it once was. He is stubborn and fiercely independent, reluctant to accept help from others, believing that only he can solve his own problems. Despite this, he has a soft spot for those who have suffered under tyranny, often going out of his way to help those he sees as kindred spirits, though he would never admit it.

He is pragmatic and practical, preferring simple solutions to complex problems. Years of blacksmithing have given him a methodical mind, and he is quick to identify flaws and weaknesses in both objects and people. While he has no love for violence, he is not afraid to use his strength and knowledge to defend himself or those he cares about.

### **Motivations and Goals**

- **Escape Sunscar**: Remus’ primary goal is to leave Sunscar behind and find peace in Ravenmoor. He believes that the dark, remote land will offer him a place to hide from his past and live quietly.
- **Seek Redemption**: Remus carries a heavy burden of guilt for the weapons he was forced to forge, weapons that harmed innocent people. While he doesn’t actively seek redemption, his actions often reflect a subconscious desire to atone for his past.
- **Survive**: Above all, Remus wants to survive. He has seen too much death and destruction to believe in heroism or noble causes. He just wants to live out his remaining days in peace, away from the chaos that has consumed his life.

### **Key Abilities and Skills**

- **Expert Blacksmith**: Remus’ skills with a hammer and anvil are unmatched. While he no longer works the forge, his knowledge of metallurgy and weapon crafting remains. He can identify the make and quality of any weapon or piece of armor and can even repair or improve them with the right materials.
- **Physical Strength**: Despite his age, Remus is still incredibly strong. Years of swinging a hammer have given him powerful arms and a solid core, making him a formidable opponent in hand-to-hand combat.
- **Survival Skills**: Having lived on the fringes of society for years, Remus is adept at surviving in harsh conditions. He can forage for food, build shelters, and navigate the wilderness with ease.

### **Role in the Campaign**

Remus can serve as a mentor or guide for the players, particularly if they are navigating through or escaping from Sunscar. His knowledge of the town and its surroundings can be invaluable. If the players earn his trust, he may offer to repair their weapons and armor or even forge new ones if they bring him the right materials.

In Ravenmoor, he could be a source of information about Sunscar’s current state or offer insight into the players' quest. If they help him find peace or redeem himself for his past actions, he could become a valuable ally, providing weapons, armor, or even joining them in battle if the need is dire.

### **Symbolism and Themes**

Remus represents the cost of war and the consequences of tyranny. His life is a testament to how even the strongest can be broken by oppression and despair. His journey from Sunscar to Ravenmoor mirrors a quest for redemption and peace, but it is also a reminder that true peace can be elusive, and the past is not easily escaped.

### **Key Plot Points**

1. **Encounter in Sunscar**: The players first meet Remus as he is preparing to leave Sunscar. He is surly and uncooperative, but if they offer to help him escape, he may provide them with valuable information or resources.
2. **Journey to Ravenmoor**: If the players travel with Remus, they will witness his struggle with his past and his hopes for the future. Along the way, he may open up about his regrets and fears, deepening their bond.
3. **New Life in Ravenmoor**: In Ravenmoor, Remus struggles to find his place. The players may help him establish a new forge or find peace in a world that is as haunted as he is. This could lead to quests involving dark magic, haunted forges, or helping other lost souls in the region.
