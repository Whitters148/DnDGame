- **Race**: Halfling
- **Class**: Rogue (Former Scout)
- **Role**: Tavern Keeper and Informant
- **Appearance**: Thistlebrook is a small, wiry halfling with brown curly hair, bright green eyes, and a mischievous smile. He wears a patchwork leather vest and breeches, often seen wiping down the bar of his modest tavern in Gloomwatch. His hands are always quick, whether it's to clean or to subtly pick up loose coins. A tattoo of a raven on his wrist hints at his past life as a scout for a thieves’ guild.
- **Backstory**: Once a scout for a notorious thieves' guild, Thistlebrook escaped the criminal life after betraying his former comrades during a botched heist. He fled to Gloomwatch, where he set up a tavern that also acts as a front for passing information. Though he's left his rogue past behind, his knowledge of underworld dealings makes him a valuable informant for those seeking rumors or covert information about the happenings in the region.
- **Personality**: Thistlebrook is charming, witty, and always ready with a story or two. He enjoys getting to know everyone who passes through his tavern, though he’s always keeping an ear out for information that might be useful. He’s a bit of a trickster, but his heart is in the right place, and he looks out for his fellow townsfolk.
