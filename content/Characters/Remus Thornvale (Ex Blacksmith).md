### **Appearance**:

Remus is a tall, broad-shouldered man with a strong, muscular build, a testament to his many years working the forge. His skin is weathered and tanned, marked by countless burns and scars from his days as a blacksmith. Once, his hair was a thick jet-black mane, but now it is sparse and silvery, framing a face etched with deep lines of worry and sorrow. His faded blue eyes, clouded by age and hardship, still possess a sharp, analytical gaze. Though he no longer works the forge, Remus still wears a simple, sturdy tunic and trousers, often covered in soot stains, along with a heavy leather apron out of habit.

### **Personality**:

Remus is a bitter, cynical man hardened by years of loss and betrayal. His experiences in **Sunscar** left him disillusioned, and he harbors a deep hatred for the town and what it became under corrupt rule. Despite his anger, there is also a profound sadness in Remus, as he remembers the Sunscar that once stood strong. He is stubborn and fiercely independent, rarely accepting help from others, convinced that he must solve his own problems. Yet, beneath his rough exterior, Remus has a soft spot for those who have suffered under tyranny, and he often goes out of his way to help kindred souls, though he would never admit it.

### **Backstory**:

Remus was once a renowned blacksmith in **Sunscar**, known for crafting some of the finest weapons and tools in the region. His pride in his craft was shattered as the town fell into the hands of ruthless warlords and corrupt officials, turning his forge into a tool of oppression. Forced to produce weapons for those who terrorized his people, Remus tried to resist by sabotaging his work, but his efforts were in vain. As the years went by, he became a shadow of his former self, weighed down by guilt and disillusionment.

After many years, Remus finally gathered enough coin to leave **Sunscar** behind. He traveled to **Ravenmoor**, seeking refuge in its dark, remote lands. His hope is to find peace, or at least escape the oppression that consumed his life in Sunscar. Currently, Remus resides in **Gloomwatch**, where he has begun a new chapter of his life as the village blacksmith.

His knowledge of the town and his ability to craft and repair weapons make him a valuable resource. In **Gloomwatch**, he could offer insight into the players' quests or provide them with much-needed supplies. If the players help him come to terms with his past or assist him in rebuilding his life in Ravenmoor, Remus may become a loyal ally who supports them with finely crafted weapons and armor. He may also join the players in combat if necessary, despite his desire to leave his violent past behind.
