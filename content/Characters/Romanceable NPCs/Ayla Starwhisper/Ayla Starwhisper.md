- **Race**: Half-Elf
- **Occupation**: Druid
- **Location**: **Hollowbrook**, Darkwood Forest

**Appearance**:

Ayla stands at 5'6" with a slender yet strong frame. Her long, chestnut-brown hair is often adorned with flowers and leaves, blending seamlessly with the forest environment. Her green eyes shimmer with an almost magical quality, and her skin carries a light tan from spending most of her life outdoors. She dresses in simple, flowing robes of earth tones, with a belt of pouches holding herbs and small enchanted trinkets.

**Personality**:

Gentle yet firm, Ayla has a deep connection to the natural world. She is compassionate and nurturing but fiercely protective of the forest and those under her care. While she maintains a calm and tranquil demeanor, she is quick to act when she senses a threat to nature. Ayla often speaks in a measured, soothing tone, but her wisdom runs deep, earned through decades of druidic practice.

**Role in the Story**:

Ayla acts as a protector of the Darkwood Forest and a spiritual guide for the people of Hollowbrook. The players may seek her out for guidance when navigating the magical dangers of the forest or to heal wounds that go beyond mere physical injuries. She may also be the key to unlocking the secrets of certain mystical artifacts hidden deep within the forest’s ancient groves.

**Romance Potential**:

Ayla is drawn to those who respect nature and show kindness to all living creatures. A romance with Ayla would develop slowly, through a deep emotional connection rather than physical attraction. Players who take the time to understand the balance of life, death, and the natural world will earn her affection. Her love is based on trust and respect, and she would seek a partner who shares her reverence for life.

**Abilities**:

- **Nature’s Grace**: Ayla can heal wounds using the power of the forest, restoring health and curing poisons or curses.
- **Shape Shifting**: Ayla can transform into various animals, aiding the players in combat or exploration.
- **Entangle**: She can call upon the vines and roots of the forest to trap enemies, giving the players control over the battlefield.
