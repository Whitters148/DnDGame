**Appearance**:

Elara stands at 6'1", her body toned yet graceful. Her skin has a faint, earthy hue, and small patches of soft brown fur cover her shoulders and arms, reminiscent of an elk's hide. Two delicate, branching horns extend from her forehead, adorned with vines and small flowers that bloom when she’s at peace. Her eyes are a deep forest green, full of compassion and wisdom. She wears a flowing, moss-green tunic and walks barefoot, exuding a calm and serene presence.
