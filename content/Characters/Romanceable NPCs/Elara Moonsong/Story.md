**Introduction Scene**:

- **Location**: In Hollowbrook Village, nestled in Darkwood Forest.
- **Scenario**: The players are sent to **Elara** for her knowledge of the forest and magical herbs to help create a cure for a village stricken by a plague or an ailment caused by a corrupted artifact.
- **First Interaction**:_Elara tends to a sick villager in the middle of her grove, her hands glowing with faint green energy._Elara (softly, without looking up):_“Nature speaks to us if we know how to listen. What is it you seek in the forest?”_
- **Romance Development**: Players who show kindness to nature or help her with druidic quests, such as protecting the forest or aiding animals, will earn her favor. She is drawn to players who share a respect for life.
