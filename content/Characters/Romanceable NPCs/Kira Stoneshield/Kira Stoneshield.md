- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Occupation**: Captain of the Guard
- **Location**: Stonehaven, Stonehearth Peaks

**Appearance**:

Kira stands at 4'8", but her sturdy build and commanding presence make her seem much taller. Her thick, auburn hair is braided tightly, matching her meticulously maintained beard, a symbol of her rank among the dwarves. Her armor is a blend of steel and stone, engraved with the sigils of Stonehaven. Her piercing blue eyes constantly scan her surroundings for danger, and her scarred face speaks of many battles fought and won.

**Personality**:

Kira is a no-nonsense leader, unafraid to speak bluntly and expect results. She is fiercely loyal to her people and values courage and honor above all else. However, beneath her tough exterior lies a heart that longs for meaningful connections, though she rarely shows it. She respects strength but admires intelligence and wit even more.

**Role in the Story**:

As the captain of the guard, Kira leads Stonehaven’s defense and will help the players if they earn her trust. She offers quests involving the protection of Stonehaven, and romance may develop through shared battles, strategy discussions, and proving the player's honor and loyalty.

**Romance Potential**:

Winning Kira’s heart requires the player to show bravery and tactical prowess in battle. She values those who fight for honor and protect the weak. Sharing drinks in a dwarven tavern and telling war stories will build her affection.

**Abilities**:

- **Stoneheart**: Kira can use her **Second Wind** to heal for 1d10 + her level once per short rest.
- **Shield Wall**: When Kira is adjacent to an ally, both gain +2 to AC.
- **Battle Command**: Kira can grant an ally an extra attack as a bonus action once per combat.
