### **Kira Stoneshield (Dwarf Captain of the Guard)**

**Introduction Scene**:

- **Location**: Stonehaven in Stonehearth Peaks.
- **Scenario**: The players arrive in **Stonehaven** needing Kira’s help to reinforce Falconstone or protect the Resistance's supply lines. Kira, skeptical of outsiders, tests the party’s mettle before agreeing to help.
- **First Interaction**:_Kira is in the middle of a weapons drill with her guards when the players arrive._Kira (gruffly):_“I don’t have time for pleasantries. Show me you can hold your own in a fight, and we’ll talk.”_
- **Romance Development**: Players who demonstrate their strength, honor, or tactical intelligence will earn Kira’s respect. Her admiration grows through shared combat and trust.
