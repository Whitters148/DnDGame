- **Location**: Duneblade Desert, often found in the town of Sunscar or patrolling the desert.

Lyra stands 5'10" with a lithe, agile build, covered in sleek gray fur that glimmers faintly in the sunlight. Her wolf-like features are striking, with sharp, golden eyes and pointed ears that give her an air of constant awareness. Her long, wild black hair is braided loosely behind her back, and her teeth flash in a half-smirk when she speaks. She dresses in leather armor adorned with desert talismans, blending in seamlessly with the environment around her.

**Personality**:

Lyra is confident, free-spirited, and deeply connected to the wilds of the desert. Sheâ€™s quick to make decisions and never hesitates to speak her mind.
