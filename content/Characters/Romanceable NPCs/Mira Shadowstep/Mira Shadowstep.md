- **Race**: Half-Fox Humanoid
- **Occupation**: Rogue/Assassin, High-ranking Member of the Nightfall Covenant
- **Location**: **Nightfall Sanctuary**, within The Wyrm’s Spine

**Appearance**:

Mira stands at 5'4" with a sleek and agile build. Her fur is a striking mix of deep auburn and black, reminiscent of the twilight, with a white patch on her chest and tail tip. Her eyes are sharp and amber, constantly scanning her surroundings with predatory awareness. Her fox-like ears twitch subtly to sounds others might miss. She dresses in tight-fitting, black leather armor, designed for stealth, adorned with subtle silver runes that indicate her high status within the Nightfall Covenant.

**Personality**:

Mira is cunning, manipulative, and highly ambitious, traits she embraces as an assassin for the Nightfall Covenant. She is cool under pressure and has a sharp, biting wit, often using it to throw her enemies off balance. Though she’s ruthless to those who cross her or the Covenant, Mira has a deeply guarded sense of loyalty to those she deems worthy, particularly her fellow Covenant members. Her fox-like nature gives her a playful and mischievous side, but it hides a deadly focus.

**Role in the Story**:

As a high-ranking member of the Nightfall Covenant, Mira is deeply involved in the faction's darker ambitions, aligning with the spread of dark magic and dark religion throughout the world. The players may encounter her when seeking information about the Covenant or attempting to retrieve artifacts linked to dark magic. Her allegiance is to the Covenant, but her actions and motivations are often mysterious, as she plays a long game in the world’s conflict. A romance with Mira will test the player’s understanding of power, manipulation, and loyalty to their own goals.

**Romance Potential**:

A romance with Mira would be intense, filled with danger and intrigue. She’s attracted to those who share her intelligence and skill in the darker arts of manipulation and stealth, or those who prove they can outwit her in a game of power. Mira respects strength and cunning above all, and a romance with her would be a test of who can navigate the treacherous waters of the Covenant while also earning her respect and loyalty. Players who show an understanding of the Covenant’s goals or assist in furthering them may spark her interest.

**Abilities**:

- **Shadowstep**: Mira can vanish into shadows, allowing her to teleport up to 60 feet as a bonus action.
- **Venomous Strike**: Once per short rest, Mira can coat her weapons in a deadly poison, dealing 3d6 poison damage on her next successful hit.
- **Cunning Action**: Mira can use her bonus action to Dash, Disengage, or Hide, making her a formidable opponent in combat.
- **Nightfall’s Blessing**: As a high-ranking member of the Covenant, Mira can call upon dark magic to grant herself resistance to necrotic damage for 1 hour.
- **Deceiver’s Mask**: Mira can cast _disguise self_ at will, using her illusion magic to blend in or manipulate others.
