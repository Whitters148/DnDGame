### **Mira Shadowstep (Half-Fox Rogue/Assassin)**

**Location**: Nightfall Sanctuary, hidden deep within The Wyrm's Spine.

---

### **Introduction Scene**:

**Location**: Inside the shadowy halls of the Nightfall Sanctuary, an ancient fortress enveloped in darkness. The players have ventured here seeking the Nightfall Covenant, either for information, to join their ranks, or as part of a quest to retrieve an artifact.

**Scenario**: The players step through the sanctuary's cold, echoing corridors, their steps barely making a sound on the stone floor. Suddenly, they sense movement in the shadows. Before they can react, a figure emerges—a half-fox humanoid, her sharp amber eyes locking onto them from beneath her hood.

### **First Interaction**:

Mira steps into the dim light, her fur a sleek blend of auburn and black, her armor almost melding into the shadows. She watches them closely, her fox-like ears twitching slightly as if listening for hidden sounds.

**Mira** (cool, with a playful smile):  
"So, you think you’re ready to play in the shadows? The Nightfall Covenant doesn’t welcome just anyone. Prove your worth... or disappear."

### **Romance Development**:

A romance with Mira is as dangerous as it is alluring. She’s drawn to those who can navigate the gray areas of morality, just as she does. Mira values strength, cunning, and intelligence, especially in matters of manipulation, stealth, and the darker arts. Earning her respect will require the players to complete delicate missions for the Nightfall Covenant, perhaps involving sabotage or assassination. As players gain her trust, they may see her mischievous, playful side, but beneath it lies the heart of a dedicated assassin with ambitions of her own.

Romance with Mira would test the players’ ability to balance loyalty, ambition, and secrecy. Prove your wit and skill, and Mira may see you as more than just another operative in the Covenant—she might start considering you a true partner, both in crime and in passion.

### **Abilities**:

- **Shadowstep**: Mira can teleport up to 60 feet as a bonus action, vanishing into and reappearing from shadows.
- **Venomous Strike**: Once per short rest, Mira coats her weapons in poison, dealing an additional 3d6 poison damage on her next successful hit.
- **Cunning Action**: Mira can use a bonus action to Dash, Disengage, or Hide, making her exceptionally mobile in combat.
- **Nightfall’s Blessing**: As a high-ranking member of the Covenant, Mira can grant herself resistance to necrotic damage for 1 hour.
- **Deceiver’s Mask**: Mira can cast _disguise self_ at will, allowing her to blend into any crowd or situation seamlessly.

### **Role in the Story**:

Mira serves as a gatekeeper for the Nightfall Covenant, offering the players insight into its darker ambitions. Whether she is an ally or an antagonist will depend on the players’ choices, but her allegiance to the Covenant is unwavering. She plays a crucial role in missions involving stealth, assassination, or retrieval of powerful artifacts tied to dark magic. Depending on the players’ actions, Mira may also provide unique paths through the story, presenting morally complex decisions that align with the Covenant’s dark principles.

### **Romance Potential**:

Mira’s romance potential is for players who embrace the shadows—those who thrive in secrecy, stealth, and cunning. She is attracted to strength of mind and skill, not just physical prowess. If a player shows a deep understanding of the Nightfall Covenant’s goals or proves themselves through clever manipulation and stealthy missions, Mira will begin to see them as more than just an ally. However, a romance with her would be full of tests, betrayals, and dangerous games of loyalty. Only those who can match her ambition and survive her world of intrigue will earn her true affection.
