- **Race**: Human
- **Occupation**: Witch/Healer
- **Location**: Gloomwatch, Ravenmoor

**Appearance**:

Selena stands at 5'6", her alabaster skin contrasting with her long, dark hair, which falls in waves down her back. Her violet eyes seem to glow in the darkness, and her voice is soft but commanding. She dresses in flowing black and purple robes adorned with arcane symbols, and she carries a staff made of dark wood, entwined with glowing runes.

**Personality**:

Selena is enigmatic and seductive, always keeping her true intentions hidden beneath layers of mystery. She’s sharp, quick-witted, and possesses a deep knowledge of dark magic. Despite her affiliation with the arcane arts, she has a compassionate side, especially toward those who are lost or in pain. However, her morals are often murky, and she doesn’t always choose the side of light or dark.

**Role in the Story**:

Selena may assist the players in learning more about the dark magic that permeates Ravenmoor or provide healing and mystical services for a price. A romance with Selena will likely be complex, full of moral ambiguity, and may require the players to make difficult decisions regarding their alignment.

**Romance Potential**:

Romancing Selena involves navigating the fine line between light and dark magic. She admires intelligence and power, and will be drawn to players who are curious, bold, and willing to step into the shadows.

**Abilities**:

- **Arcane Mastery**: Selena can cast **Charm Person**, **Hold Person**, and **Darkness** at will.
- **Fey Ancestry**: She has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put her to sleep.
- **Soul Drain**: Once per day, Selena can drain life from an enemy, dealing 3d6 necrotic damage and healing herself for the amount dealt.
