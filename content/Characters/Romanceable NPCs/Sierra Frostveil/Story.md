### **Sierra Frostveil (Human Sorceress)**

**Introduction Scene**:

- **Location**: In the icy ruins of an ancient fortress in the Frozen North.
- **Scenario**: The players are searching for a powerful magical item, and **Sierra**—a sorceress with an affinity for ice magic—is one of the few who knows its location. However, she has her own reasons for guarding the knowledge.
- **First Interaction**:_Sierra stands in the middle of a swirling snowstorm, her hands glowing with icy power._Sierra (calmly):_“I’ll help you, but the secrets you seek come with a price. Are you prepared to pay it?”_
- **Romance Development**: Sierra values wisdom and power. A romance with her may develop if the players show a deep understanding of magic and help her with personal quests in the Frozen North.
