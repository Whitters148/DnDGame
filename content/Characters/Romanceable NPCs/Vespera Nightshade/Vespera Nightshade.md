- **Race**: Human
- **Occupation**: Necromancer/Healer
- **Location**: **Gloomwatch**, Ravenmoor

**Appearance**:

Vespera stands at 5'7" with an elegant, almost ethereal frame. Her skin is pale as moonlight, giving her an otherworldly appearance. Her long, black hair flows like ink, usually swept over one shoulder in loose waves. Her piercing, ice-blue eyes seem to glow faintly in the dark, often accentuated by the shadows she walks in. She dresses in intricate black and silver robes adorned with dark lace, and her fingertips are often ink-stained from studying forbidden tomes. Around her neck, she wears an amulet in the shape of a crescent moon, pulsing with faint magical energy.

**Personality**:

Vespera is enigmatic, aloof, and carries a heavy air of mystery. She speaks softly but with conviction, often drawing others in with her dark yet captivating presence. Despite her affiliation with necromancy, Vespera has a compassionate side—she uses her powers not for evil but to protect those who cannot defend themselves, raising the dead only in times of great need. She has a melancholic, introspective nature and often contemplates the balance between life and death. Trust does not come easily to her, and she often hides her true emotions behind a veil of indifference.

**Role in the Story**:

Vespera resides in the haunted town of Gloomwatch, offering her skills in necromancy and healing to the players. Though her appearance may seem dark, her heart seeks justice for those wronged by Lord Damaris’ forces. She may provide quests related to defeating powerful undead or unsealing dark magic plaguing the region. Players who show a deep understanding of magic and empathy for those who suffer might earn her trust—and perhaps, her affection.

**Romance Potential**:

A romance with Vespera would be complex and full of moral ambiguity. She is drawn to those who walk the line between light and dark, and players who show depth, wisdom, and an appreciation for the darker aspects of life may earn her affection. Building a connection with her would require more than mere charm—it would need a demonstration of understanding and respect for the forces she wields. Vespera may also present opportunities for players to explore darker aspects of magic, though not without moral consequences.

**Abilities**:

- **Healing with Shadows**: Vespera uses her necromancy to restore life force, casting spells that can heal or revive players, though always at a cost.
- **Soulbinding**: She can temporarily bind the soul of a fallen ally to continue fighting, allowing a downed player to stay in the battle for a short time.
- **Forbidden Knowledge**: Vespera has access to ancient and powerful spells that may help the players, but using them could have repercussions.
