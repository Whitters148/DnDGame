### **Appearance**:

Selena stands at 5'6", her **ashen skin** bearing a subtle, ethereal glow that reflects her connection to the Shadowfell. Her long, dark hair falls in waves down her back, and her eyes, a deep violet, seem to glow faintly in the darkness. Her movements are graceful, almost otherworldly, and her voice is soft but commanding, as if carrying a whisper of shadows. She dresses in flowing black and purple robes adorned with arcane symbols, and she carries a staff made of dark wood, entwined with glowing runes. Intricate tattoos of ancient runes can be glimpsed on her arms, further hinting at her connection to shadow magic.

### **Personality**:

Selena is enigmatic and seductive, always keeping her true intentions hidden beneath layers of mystery. She’s sharp, quick-witted, and possesses a deep knowledge of dark magic, particularly those connected to the Shadowfell. Despite her affiliation with the arcane arts and shadow magic, she has a compassionate side, especially toward those who are lost or in pain. However, her morals are often murky, and she doesn’t always choose the side of light or dark, instead walking the line between both worlds, drawn to power and the mysteries of life and death.

---

### **Role in the Story**:

Selena may assist the players in learning more about the dark magic that permeates Ravenmoor or provide healing and mystical services for a price. Her knowledge of curses, necromancy, and shadow magic could help the players solve complex problems or delve deeper into the mysteries of the **Prison of Forgotten Souls** or **Darkwood Forest**. A romance with Selena will likely be complex, full of moral ambiguity, and may require the players to make difficult decisions regarding their alignment or the use of dark magic. She may offer dark power at a price, leading the players into morally grey territory.

---

### **Romance Potential**:

Romancing Selena involves navigating the fine line between light and dark magic. She admires intelligence, curiosity, and boldness, and will be drawn to players who are unafraid of exploring the deeper, darker corners of magic. She seeks someone who, like her, is willing to walk the edge between power and morality, and a romance with her will likely challenge the player's beliefs and values. As a **Shadar-Kai**, Selena is also drawn to the fleeting nature of life and the eternal essence of the soul, giving the romance a bittersweet, haunting quality.

### **Abilities**:

- **Arcane Mastery**: Selena can cast **Charm Person**, **Hold Person**, and **Darkness** at will, weaving shadows into her spells with ease.
- **Fey Ancestry (Shadar-Kai)**: She has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put her to sleep.
- **Blessing of the Raven Queen**: Once per day, Selena can teleport up to 30 feet, surrounded by a mist of shadows. After she teleports, she becomes **resistant to all damage** until the start of her next turn.
- **Soul Drain**: Once per day, Selena can drain life from an enemy, dealing **3d6 necrotic damage** and healing herself for the amount dealt. This ability is tied to her connection with the Shadowfell, where she draws upon the lingering spirits of the dead to restore herself.

### **Backstory (Optional)**:

Selena was once a mortal elf who made a pact with a powerful being of the Shadowfell to save her loved ones from death. In exchange, she became a Shadar-Kai, forever tied to the Shadowfell and its dark magic. Over the years, she has walked the path between life and death, light and shadow, mastering the arcane arts of necromancy and healing. She settled in **Gloomwatch**, where the eerie mists and haunted woods remind her of the Shadowfell. Now, she offers her services to those who seek healing or knowledge of the dead, but her true motives remain hidden, and few can claim to fully understand her.
