### **Appearance**:

Selimah is a slight, frail-looking woman with a quiet strength that belies her delicate frame. Her skin is pale, an oddity for someone who lived in the desert, and seems to always carry a faint sheen of moisture, as if she is surrounded by a mystical mist. Her long, silver hair cascades down her back in soft waves, often loosely braided with dried herbs and beads woven into it. She dresses in flowing robes of white and pale blue, colors reminiscent of water and air, and her wrists are adorned with bracelets made from shells, feathers, and small crystals. Selimah’s piercing pale blue eyes are almost unnerving in their clarity, and her serene face, with high cheekbones, rarely changes expression, no matter the situation. Her long, slender hands are often seen mixing potions or holding talismans.

### **Personality**:

Selimah is mysterious and cryptic, often speaking in riddles and omens. She has a deep belief in fate and destiny, always viewing events through the lens of spiritual guidance and the natural order of the world. While her serene, peaceful nature makes her a calming presence, she can be difficult to read, as her words are often open to interpretation. She rarely speaks directly, preferring to let others discover meaning in her predictions and visions. Despite her cryptic nature, Selimah is compassionate, using her knowledge of herbs and magic to heal and guide those in need, though her sadness for the fall of **Sunscar** weighs heavily on her.

### **Backstory**:

Once a renowned healer and mystic in **Sunscar**, Selimah used her talents to provide divinations, spiritual guidance, and herbal remedies to those who sought her help. Her belief in destiny made her a respected figure, as people came to her to understand their futures and the omens she interpreted. As **Sunscar** fell into chaos, Selimah tried to guide and heal her people, but she was ultimately forced to flee with the refugees. Now residing in **Falconstone**, she continues her work, setting up a healing tent to tend to the wounded and sick among the displaced. Though the fall of her home has left her deeply saddened, she continues to offer wisdom, healing, and mystical insights to those who seek her help.
