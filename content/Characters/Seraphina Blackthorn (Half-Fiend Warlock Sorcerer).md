Class: Warlock/Sorcerer (Specializing in Dark and Eldritch Magic)
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral
Location: The Abyssal Gate, a hidden fortress deep within Ravenmoor.
Appearance
Seraphina stands at 5'9" with a commanding and intense presence. Her long, platinum blonde hair cascades down her back, shimmering faintly as if reflecting the chaotic energy of her demonic heritage. She has piercing, violet eyes that glow with an inner light, hinting at the eldritch power she wields. Her skin is pale, almost porcelain, marked with intricate black runes that shimmer when she channels her magic. She wears a sleek, form-fitting black outfit adorned with silver accents and glowing eldritch runes, a blend of armored segments and flexible leather. Gothic and demonic motifs like skull ornaments and crescent moon pendants further symbolize her dark connection to the Abyss. Spiked pauldrons and bracers complete her ensemble, adding an imposing edge to her silhouette.

Personality
Seraphina is enigmatic, with a demeanor that oscillates between cold detachment and fiery passion. Her experiences have forged a strong will and steely resolve, but beneath her guarded exterior, she harbors a deep empathy for those who have suffered like she has. Her sense of humor is dry and sharp, often tinged with irony and bitterness. Though she keeps her emotions tightly controlled, she is capable of great kindness and compassion, particularly towards those seeking redemption or struggling against their inner darkness.

Role in the Story
Seraphina is the guardian of The Abyssal Gate, an ancient portal connecting the mortal realm to the Abyss. Her role is crucial in the struggle against Lord Damaris, as she alone can control the gateway, using it to banish or summon creatures from the dark planes. The players may seek her aid to seal or open this gate, depending on their goals. Convincing her to help will require navigating her complex motivations and past traumas, as she remains conflicted between using her power for good or succumbing to the darkness that haunts her.

Backstory
Born to a human mother and a powerful fiendish entity, Seraphina was marked from birth by dark forces. Her early years were spent in hiding, shunned by her village for her strange powers and feared for the demonic energy that radiated from her. When Lord Damaris’ forces discovered her, she was taken and trained as a weapon, forced to serve the very evil she sought to escape. During a mission to recover an ancient artifact, she embraced her demonic heritage in a desperate bid for survival, transforming her appearance and solidifying her bond with the weapon Riftbreaker. She later betrayed her captors, fleeing to the mountains and taking refuge within the enigmatic sanctuary of The Abyssal Gate.

Haunted by her past and the demonic blood that runs through her veins, Seraphina remains conflicted, torn between using her power to protect others and fearing that she may lose control and become the monster she was once forced to be. Her transformation serves as both a source of power and a constant reminder of the price she has paid for it.

Abilities
Eldritch Strike: Seraphina channels dark energy through her sword, Riftbreaker, unleashing devastating melee attacks infused with necrotic damage.
Shadowstep: She can teleport up to 60 feet through shadows as a bonus action, making her a dangerous and elusive opponent.
Abyssal Command: Once per long rest, Seraphina can summon a fiendish creature to fight by her side, commanding it with her will.
Riftwalker’s Defense: Seraphina can create a protective barrier of shadow energy around herself or an ally, granting resistance to all damage for one round.
Riftbreaker’s Fury: Her blade, Riftbreaker, can release a wave of dark energy, dealing necrotic damage in a 30-foot cone. Enemies hit by this wave must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed with fear until the start of their next turn.
Motivations and Goals
Seraphina’s primary goal is to free herself from the influence of her fiendish heritage and the lingering control of Lord Damaris. She seeks redemption for her past actions while under his control but fears that the power she wields will always make her a threat to those around her. She is drawn to the players because she sees in them the possibility of a path different from the one she has walked—a path of hope and freedom rather than darkness and fear.

Symbolism and Themes
Seraphina represents the struggle between light and dark within oneself, the fear of losing control, and the quest for redemption. Her character explores themes of identity, power, and the burden of past sins. Her presence in the story challenges the players to confront their own fears and make difficult choices about trust and forgiveness.

Key Plot Points Involving Seraphina
The Abyssal Gate: The players may need Seraphina’s help to control or close the Abyssal Gate, preventing Damaris from using it to summon more dark creatures.
Duel with Kaida: Seraphina may intervene in the conflict with Kaida Shadowsong, her presence and power a decisive factor in the battle’s outcome.
Inner Demons: Seraphina’s control over her fiendish side is tenuous at best. A moment of intense stress could cause her to lose control, endangering herself and those around her. The players may need to help her regain control or deal with the consequences of her losing it.
Seraphina Blackthorn is a complex, multifaceted character whose presence adds depth, intrigue, and moral complexity to the campaign. Her story intertwines with the larger narrative, offering the players a powerful ally—or a dangerous adversary—depending on how they navigate her personal quest for redemption and control.
