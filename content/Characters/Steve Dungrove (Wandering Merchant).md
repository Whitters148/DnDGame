 **Race**: Human

- **Occupation**: Wandering Peddler / Trader
- **Location**: Wandering between villages, often found on the outskirts of major towns or in unexpected places like forests or ruins, trying to sell his "rare" (mostly useless) wares.

---

#### **Appearance**:

Steve stands at an average height of 5'9" with a stocky, slightly out-of-shape build, the kind of figure that suggests he’s spent more time sitting at market stalls than engaging in any sort of physical activity. He wears a simple **blue shirt** that’s always untucked and slightly wrinkled, along with **dark blue pants** that have seen better days. His boots are caked in mud, a sign of his constant wandering, but he wears them with pride. His thinning, brown hair is hastily combed, and his face bears a scruffy, uneven beard. He’s often seen hauling a massive, rickety cart behind him, filled with an assortment of questionable goods. A comically large, wide-brimmed hat sits on his head, nearly tipping over whenever he turns too quickly.

---

#### **Personality**:

Steve is friendly but clueless. He’s always overly enthusiastic about the most mundane or useless objects, treating everything he sells like it’s the greatest treasure in the world. He’s harmless and well-meaning but often oblivious to danger, wandering into dangerous areas without realizing it, which is part of his charm and comedic appeal. He tends to talk fast and say things that make little sense, always in a rush to move onto the next deal. He’s overly optimistic, to the point where he’s often surprised when things don’t go well. Despite his scatterbrained nature, Steve always seems to escape harm—whether through luck, sheer ignorance, or the intervention of others.

#### **Role in the Story**:

Steve is not a major character, but rather a comedic cameo who pops up in unexpected places. He has a knack for showing up right when the players least expect it, usually at awkward or inconvenient times. He’ll attempt to sell them bizarre or completely unnecessary items like “anti-ghost sticks” or “potion bottles without the potions.” Most of his items are junk, but there’s a small chance that he might actually have something useful in his collection—if the players are persistent enough to dig through the nonsense. He could also accidentally provide information relevant to the plot, though it would take some effort to decode what he’s saying.

#### **Dialogue Example**:

**Steve (wide-eyed, gesturing to a rusty spoon)**:  
“Oh, ho, ho! You’ve got a keen eye! This here’s no ordinary spoon, my friends. This spoon... _this_ spoon once belonged to a legendary wizard! Yep! Stirred his tea with it every morning before battling the forces of darkness! Yours for only five silver coins—what a bargain!”

**Player**:  
“…It’s just a spoon, Steve.”

**Steve (incredulous)**:  
“Just a spoon? Just a spoon?! My dear adventurer, you clearly don’t know the value of a well-stirred potion! But hey, your loss. Oh, and speaking of potions, I’ve got a bottle here… completely empty! Why, you ask? It’s a rare opportunity! Fill it with whatever you want! Endless possibilities!”

#### **Abilities**:

Steve has no real combat abilities, though he often claims to have mystical knowledge or secret techniques that never actually come in handy. He’s mostly a non-combat NPC, but his _luck_ seems to keep him safe from harm.

- **Uncanny Luck**: If Steve is ever in direct danger, he manages to escape through sheer luck or the intervention of others, often without even realizing the threat.
- **Merchant’s Charm**: He has a way of convincing people to buy things, no matter how useless they seem, using his over-the-top enthusiasm. While his charisma isn’t particularly high, his persistence and odd charm often win people over.

---

#### **Lore/Background**:

Steve was once a failed shopkeeper in a small village, but after realizing he could wander the land and sell “adventuring goods,” he set out on the road with his trusty cart. He considers himself a world traveler and expert merchant, even though his knowledge of rare artifacts and magical items is entirely secondhand (and usually wrong). Still, he always dreams of striking it rich by selling something extraordinary—though what that might be remains unclear to him.

### **Symbolism and Themes**:

Steve represents the lighter side of the campaign—a reminder that not everything has to be serious or dire. He’s the kind of character who can inject humor into intense situations, offering comic relief when the players need it most. He might also subtly remind players not to take everything at face value, since even the strangest of items or people could surprise them.
