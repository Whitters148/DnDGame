### **Appearance**:

Thalia is a tall, elegant elf with silver-blonde hair tied back into a neat braid. She wears finely crafted robes adorned with magical runes that shimmer faintly in the light. At her side, she always carries a tome filled with arcane knowledge and spells, symbolizing her dedication to the magical arts. Her silver eyes often have a distant, analytical look, as if her mind is constantly focused on solving magical puzzles and uncovering new secrets.

### **Personality**:

Logical and precise, Thalia is a perfectionist who believes in the power of knowledge and the pursuit of arcane mastery. She values order and discipline above all else, approaching every task with a sense of purpose and determination. While she can come across as cold or distant, this is not due to a lack of empathy, but rather a deep focus on her work. Thalia respects those who share her passion for the arcane, and she is quick to acknowledge skill and intelligence in others. However, her strict adherence to discipline can make her impatient with those who lack direction or who approach magic carelessly.

### **Backstory**:

Thalia has lived in **Gloomwatch** for decades, running a shop that offers spells, scrolls, and magical components to those who can afford them. Born into a family of scholars, she was raised to value knowledge and to seek perfection in all things. She left her home long ago to travel the world, studying under various arcane masters before eventually settling in Gloomwatch. There, she founded **[[Blackbrew & Whisperwind's Arcane Emporium]]** alongside **[[Boris 'Bumbling' Blackbrew (Potion Vendor)|Boris 'Bumbling' Blackbrew]]**, her business partner and husband, who complements her with his chaotic but effective alchemical expertise. Thalia’s reputation as a skilled spell vendor and practitioner of magic has earned her respect, even from those who may find her distant.

### **Role in the Story**:

Thalia provides a variety of magical services and supplies to the players. Whether they need scrolls, spell components, or insight into arcane mysteries, Thalia is a valuable resource. Her knowledge of magic runs deep, and she may assist players with spells they cannot cast themselves or offer advice on how to enhance their own magical abilities. Thalia’s disciplined approach to magic contrasts with Boris’s chaotic methods, and players may find themselves navigating the dynamic between the two shop owners.
