### **Appearance**:

Thorn is a spectral figure, his once-human form now twisted by the dark power of undeath. He is dressed in tattered armor from a long-forgotten era, its pieces shattered and rusted. His body bears the marks of a brutal death—long, jagged scars across his torso and neck. His glowing blue eyes burn with an intense determination, a remnant of the man he once was. His hair is long and disheveled, his face gaunt and haunted, and his voice carries a low, eerie echo, as if the grave itself speaks through him.

### **Personality**:

Thorn is driven by a single purpose—redemption. He carries the weight of his past sins with him, and though his time in the world of the living has long since passed, he remains bound by a curse that keeps him wandering. Sorrowful and often lost in thought, Thorn avoids unnecessary interaction with the living, preferring to observe from the shadows. However, he will always step in to protect those in danger, seeing it as his duty to atone for the lives he failed to save. His guilt fuels his desire for redemption, though he fears that no amount of good will ever be enough to grant him peace.

### **Backstory**:

Thorn was once a knight of great renown, a hero of his time. However, a fateful battle led to his tragic demise, and it was his own arrogance and reckless decisions that caused the death of his comrades. Cursed by the very spirits of those he failed, Thorn rose from his grave as a revenant, condemned to roam the lands until he finds redemption. He has spent centuries wandering, protecting the villagers of **Gloomwatch** when he can, but his true goal is to find peace in death—something that seems ever out of reach.

### **Role in the Story**:

Thorn may serve as an ally or a mysterious figure that crosses the players' path multiple times throughout their journey. He can offer guidance, particularly on matters involving the undead, or act as a protector in critical moments. His knowledge of ancient battles, long-lost ruins, and dark magic could be invaluable to the players, though he prefers to keep a distance, fearing that he will only bring death to those around him.
