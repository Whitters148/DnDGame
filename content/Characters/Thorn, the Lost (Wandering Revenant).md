- **Role**: Side Quest Giver / Hidden Ally
- **Appearance**: A towering, skeletal figure draped in a ragged, hooded cloak. His bones are cracked and blackened, and his eyes burn with a cold, blue flame. He carries a rusted scythe that seems to hum with dark energy.
- **Personality**: Thorn is bitter and angry, filled with a relentless drive to avenge the injustice done to him and his kin. Despite his grim appearance, there are hints of sorrow and regret in his demeanor.
- **Background**: Thorn was once a warrior of Gloomwatch, betrayed and murdered by a rival faction that later fell to ruin. His spirit rose as a revenant, bound to seek vengeance. He has since regained some sense of self but is still driven by the need to right the wrongs done to him.
- **Role in the Story**: Thorn may offer quests that involve hunting down and destroying the remnants of those who wronged him. He may also aid players against powerful undead threats or provide insight into the darker history of Gloomwatch.
