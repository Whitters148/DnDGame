- **Race**: Half-Orc
- **Class**: Fighter (Former Mercenary)
- **Role**: Blacksmith and Weaponsmith
- **Appearance**: Zarash is a towering figure, standing at 6'5", with greenish-grey skin and a muscular build. His tusks protrude slightly from his lower jaw, giving him a fierce appearance. His right arm bears a long scar, a remnant of his mercenary days. He keeps his black hair tied back in a rough knot, and his amber eyes always seem to be assessing those around him. He typically wears a leather apron over his weathered armor, his large hands often gripping a hammer or blade.
- **Backstory**: Once a wandering mercenary, Zarash sought a quieter life after a brutal battle nearly cost him his life. He found refuge in Gloomwatch and now runs the village forge, crafting weapons for the Resistance and other townsfolk. Though he left his mercenary days behind, he still trains willing villagers and adventurers in combat, imparting the harsh lessons he learned on the battlefield. Despite his gruff demeanor, Zarash has a deep sense of honor and loyalty, especially to those he considers friends.
- **Personality**: Zarash is stoic and serious, rarely cracking a smile. He values strength, both physical and mental, and tends to be blunt with his opinions. However, his loyalty runs deep, and he would never abandon those he cares about.
