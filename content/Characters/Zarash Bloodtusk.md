### **Appearance**:

Zarash is an imposing figure, standing at 6'5" with a muscular build that speaks of years spent in battle. His greenish-grey skin is marred by scars, most notably a long, jagged one running down his right arm—a constant reminder of his time as a mercenary. His tusks protrude slightly from his lower jaw, giving him a fierce, warrior-like appearance, though his amber eyes carry a quiet intensity that suggests he is always assessing those around him. He keeps his black hair tied back in a rough knot and is almost always seen wearing a worn leather apron over his weathered armor. His large hands, calloused from years at the forge, often grip a hammer or a blade in his downtime.

### **Personality**:

Zarash is stoic and serious, rarely showing any outward signs of joy or amusement. He values strength and discipline, and he is blunt and direct when giving his opinions. While he may come across as gruff and unapproachable, those who know him understand that Zarash has a deep sense of honor and loyalty, especially toward those he calls friends. He believes in hard work and never shies away from a challenge, whether it’s forging a weapon or training an apprentice in the art of combat. Though not quick to trust, Zarash is fiercely protective of those he considers part of his inner circle.

### **Backstory**:

Once a renowned mercenary, Zarash led a life filled with bloodshed and conflict. His reputation for being an indomitable force on the battlefield earned him many contracts, but after a particularly brutal battle that nearly cost him his life, Zarash sought a quieter existence. He eventually found his way to **Gloomwatch**, a village shrouded in mystery and far from his old life. There, he opened a forge, dedicating himself to crafting weapons for the Resistance and other townsfolk. Despite leaving his mercenary days behind, Zarash occasionally trains willing villagers and adventurers, passing down the harsh lessons he learned on the battlefield. His days of open conflict may be over, but the weight of his past still lingers.

Players may seek him out to craft specialized equipment or train in advanced combat techniques.
