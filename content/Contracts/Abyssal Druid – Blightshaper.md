#### **Summary of the Class:**

The **Abyssal Druid – Blightshaper** wields corrupted nature, using Abyssal forces to decay, destroy, and manipulate the natural world. As masters of necrotic energy and blighted forms, they summon swarms of corrupted creatures, create zones of decay, and transform themselves into feral, Abyssal avatars.
