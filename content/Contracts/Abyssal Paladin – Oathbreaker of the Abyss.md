#### **Class Features:**

**Corrupted Smite (Level 1) – Attack Action**  
Cooldown: Uses spell slots  
You can channel the power of the Abyss into your weapon strikes. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal necrotic or fire damage, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. This damage increases by 1d8 if the target is a celestial or fey.

**Aura of Dread (Level 3) – Passive**  
Cooldown: None  
You emit an aura of oppressive darkness in a 10-foot radius around you. While within this aura, enemies must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier) or be frightened until the start of their next turn. The aura increases to 30 feet at 18th level.

**Hellish Rebuke (Level 5) – Reaction**  
Cooldown: Uses equal to Charisma modifier per long rest  
When a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to rebuke them with fire from the Abyss. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier), taking 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. The damage increases to 3d10 at 10th level, 4d10 at 15th level, and 5d10 at 20th level.

**Soulbound Oath (Level 7) – Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
Your connection to the Abyss allows you to forge a bond with a captured soul. Once per long rest, as an action, you can summon a soulbound weapon from the Abyss, dealing necrotic damage in place of its regular damage type. This weapon remains for 1 hour or until you dismiss it.

- **Abyssal Weapon Damage**: The summoned weapon deals 1d10 necrotic damage, which increases to 2d10 at 10th level, and 3d10 at 15th level.

**Hellfire Armor (Level 9) – Bonus Action**  
Cooldown: 1 short or long rest  
You can channel the infernal energy of the Abyss to form a protective layer of hellfire around yourself. As a bonus action, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Oathbreaker level + Charisma modifier. While this armor is active, any creature that hits you with a melee attack takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

**Abyssal Command (Level 11) – Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
You can command the forces of the Abyss to fight for you. You can use an action to summon 1d4 shadowy fiends (shadow demons or abyssal hounds) to fight by your side. These creatures obey your commands and disappear after 1 hour or when they are reduced to 0 hit points.

**Corrupting Aura (Level 15) – Action**  
Cooldown: None  
Your presence corrupts the very land around you. As an action, you can corrupt a 30-foot-radius area of land. All creatures within the area must make a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Additionally, any healing that occurs within this area is reduced by half.

**Dark Resurrection (Level 18) – Passive**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can choose to rise again with the power of the Abyss. You regain half of your hit points, and a wave of necrotic energy bursts forth from you. All enemies within 20 feet must make a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 necrotic damage and be knocked prone. You can use this ability once per long rest.

**Abyssal Paragon (Level 20) – Bonus Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
You become an avatar of the Abyss, channeling its dark power into your very being. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to all damage except force damage.
- Your melee weapon attacks deal an additional 2d10 necrotic or fire damage.
- You can use Hellish Rebuke without expending a reaction.
