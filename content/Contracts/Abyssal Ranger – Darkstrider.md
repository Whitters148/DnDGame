Cooldown: None (requires concentration, lasts up to 1 hour)  
You can imbue your Hunter’s Mark with abyssal energy. When you cast **Hunter’s Mark**, you can choose to deal necrotic or force damage instead of the normal extra damage. The damage from your Abyssal Hunter’s Mark increases to 1d8 at 5th level, 1d10 at 10th level, and 1d12 at 15th level.

**Dark Vision (Level 1) – Passive**  
You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can discern shades of gray in darkness, rather than relying on color vision. This range increases to 120 feet at 9th level.

**Abyssal Stride (Level 3) – Bonus Action**  
Cooldown: Uses equal to Wisdom modifier per long rest  
You gain the ability to move through difficult terrain without expending extra movement. When you are in dim light or darkness, you can move an additional 10 feet as part of your movement, and your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Abyssal Arrow (Level 5) – Bonus Action**  
Cooldown: Uses equal to Wisdom modifier per long rest  
You can imbue your arrows or ranged attacks with the power of the Abyss. As a bonus action, you can empower an attack to deal an additional 2d6 necrotic or force damage. This damage increases to 3d6 at 10th level and 4d6 at 15th level.

**Shadowmeld (Level 7) – Bonus Action**  
Cooldown: 1 short or long rest  
You can cloak yourself in shadows, becoming invisible until the start of your next turn. You can use this ability while in dim light or darkness and can move through difficult terrain without expending extra movement while cloaked.

**Dark Strikes (Level 9) – Passive**  
Your strikes are empowered by your connection to the Abyss. While your Abyssal Hunter’s Mark is active, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Additionally, if you are hidden when you attack, your damage increases by 2d6 necrotic or force damage.

**Umbral Companion (Level 11) – Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
You can summon a spectral animal companion from the Abyss to aid you in combat. Choose a creature that is appropriate to your environment (e.g., a wolf, panther, or hawk). The creature gains the following abilities:

- **Umbral Strikes**: The companion’s attacks deal 2d8 necrotic damage.
- **Shadowmeld**: It can turn invisible for 1 minute once per long rest.

**Abyssal Quiver (Level 13) – Bonus Action**  
Cooldown: Uses equal to Wisdom modifier per long rest  
You can create a quiver of spectral arrows, each imbued with void energy. For 1 minute, your ranged weapon attacks ignore cover, and each arrow deals an additional 1d6 necrotic or force damage.

**Veil of Shadows (Level 15) – Bonus Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
You can summon a veil of shadows, covering a 30-foot radius centered on you. This area becomes heavily obscured for 1 minute. You and your allies can see normally in this area, and all attacks made against creatures within the veil have disadvantage.

**Master of the Abyss (Level 18) – Bonus Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
Your connection to the Abyss has deepened, allowing you to channel its raw power. For 1 minute, your movement speed increases by 20 feet, and your weapon attacks deal an additional 2d8 necrotic or force damage.

- Focuses on controlling the battlefield and protecting allies.
- **Abyssal Ward (Level 14) – Reaction**: When a creature you can see within 30 feet takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 4d10, as a shield of void energy absorbs the attack.
