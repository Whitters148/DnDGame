#### **Class Features:**

**Abyssal Sneak Attack (Level 1) – Passive**  
Cooldown: None  
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a finesse or ranged weapon and you have advantage on the attack roll, or an ally is within 5 feet of the target, you can deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage. The damage increases to 2d6 at 3rd level, 3d6 at 5th level, and continues to scale up every odd level.

**Cloak of Shadows (Level 2) – Bonus Action**  
Cooldown: Uses equal to proficiency bonus per long rest  
You gain the ability to blend into the shadows, becoming nearly invisible to your enemies. As a bonus action, you can turn invisible until the start of your next turn, provided you are in dim light or darkness.

**Evasion (Level 5) – Passive**  
Cooldown: None  
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

**Abyssal Veil (Level 6) – Passive**  
Cooldown: None  
You gain the ability to cloak yourself in a veil of abyssal magic. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while in dim light or darkness. In addition, you can move through non-magical difficult terrain as if it were normal terrain while in shadows.

**Shadow Meld (Level 7) – Action**  
Cooldown: 1 short or long rest  
You can merge with the shadows to avoid detection. As an action, you can step into the shadows and remain invisible as long as you remain motionless in dim light or darkness. You can maintain this state for up to 10 minutes, or until you move or take an action.

**Abyssal Strikes (Level 9) – Passive**  
Cooldown: None  
When you hit a target with your Sneak Attack, you deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage. This extra damage increases to 3d6 at 14th level.

**Abyssal Blades (Level 10) – Bonus Action**  
Cooldown: None  
You can summon two shadowy daggers or shortswords as a bonus action. These weapons deal 1d6 necrotic damage and have the Finesse, Light, and Thrown properties (range 20/60). The weapons last for 1 minute or until dismissed.

**Phantom Step (Level 11) – Action**  
Cooldown: 1 short or long rest  
You can move through solid objects like a specter. As an action, you can step through solid matter as if it were air. You can pass through a wall, door, or object no thicker than 5 feet. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.

**Umbral Assassin (Level 14) – Passive**  
Cooldown: None  
You have perfected the art of striking from the shadows. When you hit a creature that is unaware of your presence with a melee attack, you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Additionally, you can use Sneak Attack even if you don’t have advantage on the attack roll, as long as you are in dim light or darkness.

**Spectral Rebirth (Level 18) – Passive**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
Your form becomes intertwined with the Abyss. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to return to life with 1 hit point at the start of your next turn. When you do so, you become partially incorporeal for 1 minute, gaining resistance to all damage except force damage. Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest before using it again.

#### **Subclass: Abyssal Paths (3rd Level)**

At 3rd level, the Specter chooses a specialization that defines their stealth and assassination techniques within the Abyss. Two potential archetypes are:

**Path of the Abyssal Slayer:**  
Focuses on maximizing single-target damage and quick, brutal attacks. Specters following this path gain abilities that increase critical hit chance, as well as bonus damage against wounded enemies.

- **Umbral Execution (Level 14) – Bonus Action**  
    Cooldown: None  
    When you attack a creature with less than half its hit points, you can deal an additional 4d6 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, you regain the use of this ability.

**Path of the Shadowed Trickster:**  
Focuses on deception, illusion, and mobility. These Specters can create illusory duplicates, mislead enemies, and escape from harm with teleportation abilities.

- **Shadow Mirage (Level 14) – Bonus Action**  
    Cooldown: 1 short or long rest  
    You can create an illusory duplicate of yourself that lasts for 1 minute. As a bonus action, you can swap places with the mirage, confusing enemies. The mirage has an AC equal to your own and disappears if struck by an attack.
