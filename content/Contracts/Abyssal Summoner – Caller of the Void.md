**Empowered Summoning (Level 5) – Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
You can empower your summoned creature with abyssal energy. As an action, choose one summoned creature. It gains advantage on attack rolls, resistance to necrotic damage, and deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage with each attack for 1 minute.

**Summon Greater Voidspawn (Level 7) – Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
You can summon a more powerful creature from the Abyss. Choose one of the following creatures: Nightmare, Wraith, or **Greater Cold Void Spawn** (dealing cold damage). This creature obeys your commands and lasts for 1 hour or until it is destroyed. You can use this ability once per long rest.

**Void Shield (Level 9) – Reaction**  
Cooldown: 1 short or long rest  
When you or a summoned creature you control is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to conjure a shield of void energy. The target gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your Abyssal Summoner level and resistance to the triggering attack's damage type.

**Mass Summoning (Level 11) – Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
You can call upon the Abyss to summon multiple creatures at once. As an action, you summon 2 additional creatures of your choice (that you are capable of summoning). These creatures obey your commands and last for 1 hour or until destroyed.

**Void Conduit (Level 13) – Bonus Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
As a bonus action, you and your summoned creatures become conduits of the Void. For the next minute, all of your summoned creatures gain advantage on attack rolls, and you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage they deal.

**Spectral Weaponry (Level 15) – Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
You imbue one of your summoned creatures with **spectral weapons**, causing their attacks to deal an additional 2d6 **force damage** for 1 minute. This empowerment turns their weapons into ethereal blades or scythes, cutting through armor with ease.

**Summon Abyssal Lord (Level 17) – Action**  
Cooldown: 1 long rest  
You can summon an Abyssal Lord for 1 minute. This creature has the stats of a **Balor** or another large demon from the Abyss. It obeys your commands and lasts for 1 minute or until destroyed. You can only use this ability once per long rest.

**Abyssal Resilience (Level 18) – Passive**  
You and your summoned creatures gain resistance to **cold, necrotic, and psychic** damage, reflecting the harsh, chaotic nature of the Abyss. Your connection to the Void fortifies your soul and makes you harder to harm.

**Abyssal Mastery (Level 20) – Passive**  
Your control over the Abyss reaches its peak. You can maintain control of **4 summoned creatures** at once, and your **Abyssal Summon**, **Spectral Weaponry**, and **Empowered Summoning** abilities now deal an additional **1d6 force damage**. Additionally, once per long rest, you can summon a **Void Rift** in a 30-foot radius around you. All creatures within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier) or take **8d6 force damage** and be knocked prone. Summoned creatures are unaffected by this ability.
