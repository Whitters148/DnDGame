### **Soul Binding (Level 7)**

- **Action Type**: Action
- **Cooldown**: 1 short or long rest
- **Duration**: 1 minute (10 rounds of combat)
- **Range**: 30 feet

You can bind the soul of a creature that has died within the last minute, calling it back as an incorporeal servant under your control. The creature’s soul retains some of its original combat capabilities but becomes ghostly and incorporeal. It will act on your commands during this time, providing extra combat or utility options.

### **Mechanics of Soul Binding**

1. **Eligible Creatures**:
    
    - You can only bind the soul of a creature that has died within the past minute.
    - The creature can be any humanoid or beast of a CR (Challenge Rating) equal to or lower than half your Ghostcaller level. For example, at level 7, you can bind the soul of a creature with a CR of 3 or lower.
2. **Incorporeal Nature**:
    
    - Once bound, the creature becomes a ghostly form of itself. It gains the **Incorporeal Movement** trait, allowing it to move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If the creature ends its turn inside an object, it takes 1d10 force damage.
3. **Spirit’s Stats**:
    
    - **HP**: The bound spirit’s hit points become equal to your Ghostcaller level x 2.
    - **Attack**: The spirit retains one basic attack it had in life (usually its primary attack) but deals necrotic or psychic damage instead of its normal damage type.
        - Example: If you bind a wolf, its bite would deal 1d6 + Wisdom modifier necrotic or psychic damage instead of piercing damage.
    - **AC**: The spirit’s armor class is 10 + your Wisdom modifier.
4. **Actions on Behalf of the Player**:
    
    - On the Ghostcaller’s turn, you can use your **bonus action** to command the spirit to take one of the following actions:
        - **Attack**: The spirit makes an attack using its primary attack (e.g., bite, claw, or weapon attack). It can deal necrotic or psychic damage, based on your choice when binding the spirit.
        - **Scout**: The spirit can move up to its full speed and attempt to spot hidden enemies or scout ahead for traps and dangers.
        - **Defend**: The spirit imposes disadvantage on the next attack made against an ally within 5 feet of it, using its ghostly form to deflect attacks.
        - **Aid**: The spirit can provide the **Help** action to assist an ally with their next attack or ability check.
5. **Limited Abilities**:
    
    - The bound soul is limited in its ability to take complex actions like casting spells or using legendary actions. However, it retains basic movement and combat capabilities, making it an effective fighter or scout.
6. **Soul’s Weakness**:
    
    - The bound soul is vulnerable to **radiant damage** and **force damage**. It also has disadvantage on saving throws made against effects that banish or turn undead.
7. **Fading Away**:
    
    - After 1 minute, the bound soul fades back into the Abyss or afterlife. If the soul’s HP is reduced to 0 during this time, the binding ends early.

### **Example of Soul Binding in Play:**

- **Scenario**: The party has just defeated a pack of wolves, and the Ghostcaller wishes to bind the soul of one wolf to help scout ahead and defend the party during their exploration of a haunted ruin.
- **Action**: The Ghostcaller uses **Soul Binding** on the body of a wolf, summoning its spirit to aid the party.
- **Combat Use**: The Ghostcaller commands the wolf to **attack** an enemy, using a bite that now deals necrotic damage. On the Ghostcaller’s next turn, they use their bonus action to command the wolf to **scout** ahead and search for traps or hidden enemies.
- **Duration**: The wolf spirit remains for 1 minute, fading back into the Abyss after serving the Ghostcaller.

### Thematic Flavor:

The bound spirit is visibly ghostly and transparent, with a spectral, eerie appearance. While it fights and obeys the Ghostcaller, it might display traits of its former life—howling or growling if it’s a beast, or whispering and murmuring if it’s a humanoid soul. The bond between the Ghostcaller and the soul is a temporary one, as the spirit is called back from the Abyss for a limited time to carry out tasks.
