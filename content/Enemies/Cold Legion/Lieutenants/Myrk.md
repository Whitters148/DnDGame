### **Appearance**:

#### **In Symbiote Form**:

Myrk takes on a terrifying appearance in symbiote form, covered in a blood-red and blue mass of writhing tentacles and claws. His body shifts and morphs constantly, able to sprout deadly appendages or weapons as needed. His eyes glow a bright crimson, and his form can blend seamlessly into darkness, allowing him to become invisible to both the naked eye and magical senses.

#### **Host Appearance** (Pre-Symbiote):

As **Darin Blackstone**, Myrk’s host was a knight of noble lineage who became disillusioned with the light. His chiseled features and piercing blue eyes once spoke of righteousness, but the symbiote’s corruption has hardened his appearance into one of cold malice. His once gleaming armor is now tainted by the symbiote, shifting and twisting with Myrk’s power.

### **Personality**:

#### **Darin (Host) Personality**:

Darin was a disciplined warrior before bonding with Myrk. He still retains a strong sense of control, using Myrk’s power for strategic purposes. However, Darin struggles with the symbiote’s violent urges, walking a fine line between wielding its immense power and falling into savagery.

#### **Symbiote Personality**:

Myrk is calculating, cunning, and aggressive. Unlike other chaotic symbiotes, Myrk seeks dominance through control and stealth. It respects Darin’s tactical mind but constantly pushes him to unleash more of their combined strength. Myrk views violence as a tool to achieve its ends, but it craves the complete submission of those around it.

---

### **Backstory**:

Once a knight sworn to defend the weak, **Darin Blackstone** became corrupted by darkness after a failed mission left him disillusioned. When the symbiote found him, Darin willingly accepted its power, seeing it as a means to restore his honor. Now bonded with **Myrk**, Darin serves **Eryx** as an enforcer of shadows, using the symbiote’s abilities to control and eliminate threats with ruthless efficiency.

---

### **Key Motivations**:

Myrk seeks to control and dominate all that stands in its path. Darin shares this goal, though he maintains a level of restraint that tempers the symbiote’s bloodlust. Together, they aim to expand Eryx’s influence by turning the shadows and the unseen into their greatest weapon.

---

### **Relationships**:

Myrk has a distant relationship with the other lieutenants. It respects **Tendrath** for his control over the battlefield but views him as too rigid. **Raze**’s chaotic nature contrasts with Myrk’s more strategic approach, creating friction between the two. Myrk, however, appreciates **Scyther’s** cunning, finding their goals of control somewhat aligned.

---

### **Role in Campaign**:

Myrk specializes in stealth, assassination, and battlefield manipulation. His encounters with the players involve ambushes, sneak attacks, and the strategic use of the environment to his advantage. Myrk often plays a supporting role in larger battles, turning the tide by eliminating key targets or weakening defenses from the shadows.

### **Abilities/Powers**:

- **Shapeshifting and Cloaking**: Myrk can alter its form, becoming invisible or morphing into deadly weapons such as claws or tendrils.
- **Superhuman Strength**: Myrk possesses the strength of both Venom and Carnage, surpassing them in raw power.
- **Web-Slinging and Wall-Crawling**: Myrk retains the ability to swing from tendrils and scale walls, allowing for extreme mobility.
- **Tendril and Claw Creation**: Myrk can sprout claws, tendrils, and snares from its body, using them to trap or attack enemies from a distance.
- **Resistant to Fire and Sonic Attacks**: Myrk is more resistant than most symbiotes to traditional weaknesses, making it harder to defeat.

#### **Connection to Toxin**:

Like **Toxin**, Myrk thrives on physical power and domination but is also highly adaptable and strategic. Its ability to blend into the environment and use its immense strength to overcome enemies makes it one of the most versatile and dangerous lieutenants under Eryx.
