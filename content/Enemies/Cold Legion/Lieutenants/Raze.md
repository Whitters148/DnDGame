### **Appearance**:

#### **In Symbiote Form**:

When fully consumed by the symbiote, **Raze** takes on a fiery, chaotic appearance. Her body is covered in yellow and red tendrils that cascade like burning flames. Her hair becomes long, flowing tendrils that whip around unpredictably, lashing out at nearby foes. Her eyes glow red with a maniacal light, and her teeth sharpen into jagged fangs, completing the terrifying visage of destruction.

#### **Host Appearance** (Pre-Symbiote):

Before bonding with the symbiote, **Selene Ashenclaw** was a fierce warrior known for her ferocity in battle. With fiery red hair and pale skin, she cut an intimidating figure even before the symbiote took hold. Her fierce demeanor and aggressive combat style made her a natural host for Raze, who feeds off her bloodthirsty nature. Her armor, once a simple barbarian's gear, now fuses with the symbiote, giving her an unpredictable and chaotic form in battle.

### **Personality**:

#### **Selene (Host) Personality**:

As **Selene**, Raze’s host was already prone to violence and rage. A fierce barbarian from the northern tribes, she thrived in battle and relished the chaos of combat. The symbiote has amplified these tendencies, turning her into a relentless force of destruction. Despite the chaotic nature of her actions, Selene retains a degree of cunning, using her ferocity strategically to overwhelm her enemies.

#### **Symbiote Personality**:

The Raze symbiote is wild, primal, and aggressive. It revels in chaos and destruction, pushing Selene to unleash her full fury without hesitation. Raze feeds off the fear and pain of others, making it particularly dangerous in chaotic battle environments. The symbiote craves violence and constantly drives Selene to act on impulse, attacking anything in its path.

### **Backstory**:

Once a barbarian warrior from the northern reaches, **Selene Ashenclaw** was feared for her bloodthirsty nature and ruthless combat tactics. Her savage prowess caught the attention of **Eryx**, who saw her as the perfect host for the Raze symbiote. When the symbiote bonded with her, Selene became a terrifying force of destruction, leading assaults on villages and strongholds in the Frozen North. Her ferocity combined with Raze’s chaotic tendencies makes her one of Eryx’s most dangerous lieutenants.

---

### **Key Motivations**:

Raze is driven by a desire to spread chaos and destruction, seeing combat as the ultimate expression of freedom. She fights not for strategy or control, but for the sheer thrill of battle. Her primary goal is to tear down any opposition to Eryx and to revel in the destruction of anyone who dares to stand against her.

---

### **Relationships**:

Raze has little respect for the other lieutenants, seeing them as tools for battle rather than equals. She despises the more controlled and calculating lieutenants like **Scyther**, whose tactical approach clashes with her chaotic style. However, she finds a kindred spirit in **Vorrath**, appreciating his bloodthirsty nature, even though they often clash for dominance on the battlefield.

### **Role in Campaign**:

Raze serves as a destructive force, leading raids and assaults against key resistance locations. Her battles are chaotic and frenzied, with players needing to navigate the unpredictable nature of her combat style. Raze’s encounters are marked by sudden, violent ambushes, where she uses her tendrils to strike at enemies from unexpected angles, and her overwhelming strength to crush anyone who stands in her way.

### **Abilities/Powers**:

- **Tendril Hair**: Raze can use her long tendrils to strike, entangle, and crush enemies, giving her an unpredictable combat style.
- **Superhuman Strength and Agility**: Raze’s symbiote enhances her physical abilities, making her incredibly strong and fast, able to rip through enemies with ease.
- **Camouflage**: Raze can blend into her surroundings, using her shapeshifting abilities to become nearly invisible before launching surprise attacks.
- **Wall-Crawling and Webbing Generation**: Like many symbiotes, Raze can crawl on walls and generate webbing to trap or disable her enemies.
- **Rage-Fueled Healing**: The symbiote heals Raze quickly, especially when she is in the heat of battle, allowing her to shrug off damage and continue her assault.

#### **Connection to Scream**:

Raze, like **Scream**, thrives on chaos and unpredictability. Her tendril-hair is both a weapon and a symbol of her primal nature, lashing out at enemies in a frenzied fashion. Her desire for destruction and her ability to manipulate her form for combat mirrors **Scream’s** wild, bloodthirsty personality.
