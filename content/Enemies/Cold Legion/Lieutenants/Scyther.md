### **Appearance**:

#### **In Symbiote Form**:

Scyther’s symbiote form takes on a metallic blue and purple hue, giving off a mechanical, cold appearance. Her body is covered in cybernetic tendrils that pulse with electricity and can shift into various technological tools or weapons. Her eyes glow a bright blue, with white sclera, reflecting her technopathic connection. Scyther's form appears sleek but with jagged, mechanical edges, symbolizing her integration with technology. Her tendrils constantly interface with nearby machinery, amplifying her power.

#### **Host Appearance** (Pre-Symbiote):

As **Nyx Ironvale**, Scyther’s host was a slender and cunning half-elf, known for her sharp intellect and expertise in technological magic. With pale skin and raven-black hair, Nyx kept a professional demeanor, always working with precision. Her clothing, once a mixture of elven robes and mechanical tools, now fuses with the symbiote to become a seamless, armored interface, reflecting her transition into something more than human.

### **Personality**:

#### **Nyx (Host) Personality**:

As **Nyx**, Scyther’s host was known for her calm and collected demeanor, always approaching problems with a logical mind. Her intellectual approach to technology made her a natural technomancer, and she relishes the control and power the symbiote gives her. She tends to avoid brute force in favor of tactical planning, letting her abilities control the battlefield through tech manipulation. Nyx retains some independence but has grown colder and more detached over time due to the symbiote’s influence.

#### **Symbiote Personality**:

The Scyther symbiote is aggressive and controlling, enjoying the feeling of dominance over technology and others. It sees everything around it as a potential tool to exploit, especially machines and magical devices. It encourages Nyx to rely more on raw power and control, often pushing her to act with more force and to bend others to their will. Scyther craves complete dominance and resents any form of resistance or freedom.

### **Backstory**:

Nyx Ironvale was once a respected technomancer who specialized in blending elven magic with cutting-edge technology. Her insatiable curiosity led her to seek greater power, eventually bringing her into contact with **Eryx** and the Scyther symbiote. Though initially resistant, Nyx was corrupted by the allure of ultimate control over machines, merging fully with Scyther to become a weapon of technological domination. Now, she serves Eryx loyally, using her abilities to control and manipulate the battlefield through a fusion of magic and machines.

---

### **Key Motivations**:

Scyther seeks to establish herself as the dominant force in any situation, using her technopathic abilities to manipulate her environment and subjugate others. Her goal is to expand Eryx’s influence by turning technology and magic against the resistance, forcing others to submit to the power of the symbiote collective.

---

### **Relationships**:

Scyther views the other lieutenants as tools or rivals, depending on the situation. She has a particular distaste for **Tendrath**, whose direct combat style she finds crude and inefficient. However, she respects **Thrashor** for his brute strength, recognizing the strategic advantage of his power. Scyther often acts in secret, using her technological control to gain leverage over others without them knowing.

### **Role in Campaign**:

Scyther excels in encounters involving technology or magical devices, often ambushing players by manipulating their surroundings or using machines to her advantage. She can disrupt technological or magical defenses, forcing players to adapt to her unique abilities. Her encounters will often involve complex puzzles, traps, or battles against machines under her control.

#### **Connection to Scorn**:

Scyther, like **Scorn**, excels in controlling technology and adapting it to her needs. Her abilities allow her to manipulate her environment in creative ways, combining the physical prowess of the symbiote with the technological superiority she commands. This balance of intellect and aggression makes Scyther a deadly adversary on the battlefield.
