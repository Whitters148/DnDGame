### **Appearance**:

#### **In Symbiote Form**:

Tendrath, when fully enveloped by the symbiote, becomes a fearsome figure. His once-human form is consumed by a slick, dark-green membrane, his flesh replaced by writhing tendrils that extend from his back and shoulders. These tendrils are constantly shifting and curling, always ready to strike. The green of his symbiote form is shot through with streaks of black and pulsating veins, giving him a living, predatory appearance. His eyes glow a deep emerald, with black sclera, and his mouth stretches into a predatory grin filled with jagged teeth, further enhancing his dangerous presence.

The tendrils themselves appear semi-autonomous, moving in unpredictable ways, lashing out at nearby threats. They seem to have a mind of their own, acting both as weapons and sensory extensions, reacting to danger even before Tendrath himself does.

#### **Host Appearance** (Pre-Symbiote):

As a human, Tendrath’s host, **Ramon Frostweaver**, was a hardened soldier with a tall, athletic build, trained for life in the Frozen North. He had pale skin, ice-blue eyes, and sharp, chiseled features that reflected his military discipline. His hair, once dark, has been partially bleached by the cold environment and his exposure to the symbiote’s corruption. Ramon’s face is stern, with a permanent scowl, shaped by years of commanding forces in harsh environments. His combat gear was once standard-issue northern military, but now it is fused with the symbiote, blending black leather with green, tendril-covered plating.

### **Personality**:

#### **Ramon (Host) Personality**:

Tendrath, as **Ramon**, is a cold and calculating tactician, his mind fully bent to the will of **Eryx**. He views combat not as a chaotic brawl, but as an intricate dance where precision and control are key. Unlike other lieutenants who revel in pure destruction, Tendrath sees the battlefield as something to be dominated through meticulous planning and versatile use of his tendrils. His actions are driven by an insatiable need to exert control over his enemies, turning them into helpless prey caught in his ever-moving tendrils.

Though fiercely loyal to Eryx, Tendrath retains a slight spark of his former human self—Ramon—whose disciplined military mind is what attracted the symbiote to him in the first place. However, any resistance to Eryx’s will is swiftly extinguished, with Tendrath embracing his role as the Cold Legion’s enforcer.

#### **Symbiote Personality**:

The symbiote itself, while loyal to **Eryx**, has a more primal, predatory nature compared to Ramon. It thrives on the sensation of power and control, reveling in the pain and fear it inflicts on its enemies. Where Ramon is calculated, the symbiote is more instinctual, responding to threats with lightning-fast aggression and an almost animalistic hunger to dominate.

It constantly pushes Ramon to act with more aggression, urging him to strike swiftly and without hesitation. The symbiote craves control and sees other beings as little more than prey to be consumed, either physically or by bending their will to its own. Its relationship with Ramon is symbiotic but tense, as it often tries to overpower his more strategic nature with its raw, violent instincts. This internal struggle makes Tendrath a dangerous and unpredictable foe, as his tactics can switch from calculated strikes to wild, vicious assaults depending on which aspect of his personality is in control at any given moment.

### **Backstory**:

Once known as **Ramon Frostweaver**, Tendrath was a decorated military commander tasked with defending the northern territories from invaders. His career was marked by his ability to adapt to any battlefield situation, using the frozen environment to outmaneuver and outlast his enemies. However, when he encountered Eryx and their symbiotic force, Ramon was corrupted by the promise of greater power—power beyond what a mere human could wield.

Now transformed by the symbiote into **Tendrath**, he leads the Cold Legion, a group of elite warriors similarly infected and twisted by Eryx’s influence. His once-human mind has been suppressed by the symbiote’s cold, predatory instincts, turning him into a weapon of control and precision.

---

### **Key Motivations**:

Tendrath is motivated by a desire to prove his dominance over the battlefield, using his symbiotic powers to control and manipulate the environment and his enemies. He believes in absolute submission to Eryx, convinced that free will is a chaotic force that weakens the north. His primary goal is to crush any resistance in the Frozen North and expand Eryx’s influence, turning every being he encounters into an extension of the symbiotic collective.

---

### **Relationships**:

Tendrath sees the other lieutenants as rivals more than allies. He respects their power, but he believes that his versatile abilities make him the superior enforcer of Eryx’s will. His cold, calculating nature puts him at odds with more chaotic figures like **Vorrath**, whose bloodthirsty tendencies conflict with Tendrath’s need for control and precision.

Despite this, he holds a grudging respect for **Thrashor**, whose brute strength complements his own tactical mind in large-scale battles. However, Tendrath’s disdain for manipulation makes him wary of **Scyther**, whose reliance on tech and subterfuge goes against Tendrath’s direct approach.

---

### **Role in Campaign**:

Tendrath serves as a recurring enemy for the players, leading ambushes and orchestrating strategic strikes on key strongholds in the Frozen North. He excels in combat scenarios where the players are outnumbered, using his tendrils to control the battlefield and incapacitate them before going in for the kill. His presence on the battlefield is a constant threat, and players will need to be prepared for a multifaceted opponent who adapts to their strategies.

### **Abilities/Powers**:

- **Symbiotic Tendrils**: Tendrath can manipulate and extend whip-like tendrils from his body, using them to strike, ensnare, or grab enemies from a distance. These tendrils give him a distinct advantage in ranged combat and can be used to block attacks or create traps.
- **Enhanced Physical Abilities**: Like all symbiotes, Tendrath grants his host enhanced strength, speed, and durability. His reflexes are nearly instantaneous, and his tendrils can block or deflect projectiles mid-flight.
- **Tendril Communication**: Tendrath can extend his control over lesser beings through physical contact with his tendrils, temporarily turning them into extensions of his will.
- **Symbiotic Healing**: Tendrath can heal his wounds rapidly, making him highly resilient in prolonged combat scenarios. His tendrils can also sap life force from enemies to fuel his regeneration.

#### **Connection to Lasher**:

- Tendrath, like **Lasher**, excels in using his tendrils for both offensive and defensive purposes. His ability to control multiple tendrils at once gives him an advantage in battlefield control, allowing him to engage multiple enemies simultaneously or focus his attacks with precision. His strategic, cold approach to combat mirrors **Lasher’s** tactical versatility, making him a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.
