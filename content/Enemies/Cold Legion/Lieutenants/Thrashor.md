### **Appearance**:

#### **In Symbiote Form**:

When fully bonded with the symbiote, **Thrashor** becomes a towering figure of immense bulk and power. His gray, black-veined form exudes physical dominance, with muscular limbs that can shift into brutal, heavy weapons such as warhammers or axes. His eyes glow a fierce white, and his mouth bears a jagged, toothy grin, adding to his monstrous appearance. His size and the density of his form make him resemble an unstoppable juggernaut on the battlefield.

#### **Host Appearance** (Pre-Symbiote):

Before becoming Thrashor, **Garron Stonebreaker** was a grizzled warrior from the northern tribes, renowned for his physical strength and endurance. With a stocky, muscular build and a no-nonsense attitude, Garron fought as a mercenary, favoring blunt, brutal weapons like maces and hammers. His brown hair and rugged beard are now twisted by the symbiote’s influence, merging into a darker, more menacing form.

### **Personality**:

#### **Garron (Host) Personality**:

Garron Stonebreaker was a soldier who believed in power through strength. Ruthless and straightforward, he saw combat as the ultimate test of one’s worth. After bonding with the Thrashor symbiote, these traits were amplified, driving him to seek dominance over all who opposed him. Garron is methodical in his destruction, preferring overwhelming force to subterfuge or trickery.

#### **Symbiote Personality**:

The Thrashor symbiote thrives on brute force and physical confrontation. It pushes Garron to engage in direct, devastating attacks, reveling in the destruction of anything in its path. Unlike more cunning symbiotes, Thrashor seeks power through straightforward combat, crushing enemies with raw strength and turning Garron into an indomitable enforcer.

---

### **Backstory**:

Once a mercenary known for his overwhelming strength, **Garron Stonebreaker** carved out a reputation as a soldier-for-hire in the harsh lands of the Frozen North. When the symbiote found him, Garron eagerly accepted the promise of even greater power, becoming **Thrashor**, Eryx’s weapon of brute force. Now, he serves as the muscle behind Eryx’s plans, leading assaults and crushing opposition through sheer might.

---

### **Key Motivations**:

Thrashor is driven by a desire to prove his strength, seeking out the toughest opponents and obliterating any who challenge him. He believes in the survival of the fittest and sees his role as ensuring that Eryx’s forces dominate through raw power.

---

### **Relationships**:

Thrashor holds little regard for those who rely on cunning or trickery. He respects **Tendrath** for his battlefield control but views him as too calculating, preferring his own direct approach. Thrashor holds a grudging respect for **Vorrath**, recognizing a kindred spirit in their shared love of combat, though they often clash for dominance.

---

### **Role in Campaign**:

Thrashor serves as a powerful frontline combatant, leading brutal assaults on key resistance fortifications. He is often encountered in large-scale battles, where his sheer strength makes him a force to be reckoned with. Players will need to employ strategy to avoid being overpowered by his devastating attacks, as Thrashor is designed to break through defenses and crush opposition with overwhelming force.

---

### **Abilities/Powers**:

- **Weapon Creation**: Thrashor can morph his limbs into massive weapons like warhammers or axes, delivering devastating blows to enemies.
- **Enhanced Strength and Durability**: Thrashor’s physical power is unmatched, allowing him to overpower most enemies with ease. His durability makes him resistant to damage, able to shrug off most attacks.
- **Wall-Crawling and Webbing Generation**: Thrashor retains the classic symbiote abilities of wall-crawling and webbing, though he prefers direct combat.
- **Symbiotic Healing**: Thrashor can heal rapidly, making him nearly unstoppable in prolonged battles.

#### **Connection to Riot**:

Like **Riot**, Thrashor’s focus is on brute strength and domination. His ability to morph his limbs into heavy weapons and his reliance on raw physical power mirror **Riot’s** combat style, making him a juggernaut on the battlefield and one of the most physically dangerous lieutenants under Eryx.
