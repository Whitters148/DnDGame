**Tactics**:

- SandStriders use their natural surroundings to their advantage, relying on Stealth and quick ambushes.
- They will often start an encounter with their **Sandstorm Feint** to blind enemies and either retreat or press the attack using their agility and ranged attacks.
- In groups, they coordinate to trap and outmaneuver their foes, setting ambushes in the harsh desert environment.
