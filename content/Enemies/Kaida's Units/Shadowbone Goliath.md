**Abilities**:

- **Undead Fortitude**: If damage reduces the Shadowbone Goliath to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken), unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the Goliath drops to 1 hit point instead.
- **Shadowbone Armor**: The Shadowbone Goliath gains a +2 bonus to AC while standing in dim light or darkness.
- **Crushing Grip**: When the Goliath hits with a melee attack, it can attempt to grapple (escape DC 17). While grappling a creature, the Goliath can make a **Bone Crush** attack as a bonus action.

**Tactics**:  
The **Shadowbone Goliath** serves as a relentless tank in Kaida’s forces, used for crushing enemies through sheer brute force. With high hit points and the ability to resist death through **Undead Fortitude**, the Goliath is difficult to bring down. It excels in close-range combat, using **Crushing Grip** to immobilize enemies and **Bone Crush** to deal devastating damage. Its **Shadowbone Armor** ability also makes it especially dangerous in environments filled with shadows, a common theme in Kaida’s territory.
