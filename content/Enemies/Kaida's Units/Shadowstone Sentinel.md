**Abilities**:

- **Stonewall Defense**: The Sentinel can use its **reaction** to impose disadvantage on an attack roll made against a creature within 5 feet of it.
- **Immovable Stance**: The Shadowstone Sentinel cannot be moved against its will (through spells like _Thunderwave_ or _Repelling Blast_) and has advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone.
- **Fortified Armor**: Critical hits against the Sentinel become normal hits unless the attack is made with a magical weapon or spell.
- **Sentinel of Darkness**: The Shadowstone Sentinel can emit a pulse of darkness, creating a 30-foot radius of magical darkness centered on itself, which lasts for 1 minute or until dispelled.

**Actions**:

- **Multiattack**: The Shadowstone Sentinel makes two attacks with its **Greatsword**.
- **Greatsword**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit_: 2d10 + 4 slashing damage.
- **Stone Fist**: Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit_: 1d10 + 4 bludgeoning damage.

**Reinforced Slam (Recharge 5-6)**:  
The Sentinel slams its fists into the ground, sending a shockwave through the earth in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

**Legendary Action**:

- **Shadowstone Guard (Costs 2 Actions)**: The Sentinel projects an aura of fortification in a 15-foot radius. All allies within this radius gain +2 to AC until the start of the Sentinelâ€™s next turn.

### Tactics and Features:

- **Shadowstone Sentinel** serves as a defensive powerhouse. Its ability to impose disadvantage on attacks against allies and its high AC make it ideal for holding choke points. With its _magical darkness_ ability, it can create areas where players are forced to fight at a disadvantage unless they have darkvision or magic that counters it.
