### **Combat Tactics**

Silent Sentinels act as stalwart defenders of their allies, often placed at key choke points or standing guard over important locations. Their **Sentinel’s Guard** ability helps them control the battlefield by ensuring that enemies can’t easily break through their defenses. They will often try to use their **Shield Bash** to knock enemies prone, allowing their allies to capitalize on the advantage.
