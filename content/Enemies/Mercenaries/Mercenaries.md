### **Mercenary Presence Across the Regions**:

- **Duneblade Desert**: Mercenaries act as the frontline for General Varathor, patrolling relic sites, ambushing trade caravans, and preparing for the assault on Sunscar.
- **Darkwood Forest**: Here, mercenaries are often used as scouts and disruptors, attacking Resistance hideouts or laying traps to prevent movement through the forest.
- **Ravenmoor**: Mercenaries are sent in smaller numbers, often working alongside **Kaidaâ€™s Assassins**. They are used for targeted strikes and sabotage against key Resistance figures
