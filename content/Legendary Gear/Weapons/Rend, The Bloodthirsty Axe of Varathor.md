**Properties**:

- Heavy

### **Description**:

**Rend** is a massive, brutal greataxe forged from **black iron** and imbued with **dark magic flames** that constantly flicker along its jagged edge. The weapon is covered in the **scorch marks** and **blood stains** of countless battles, and it radiates a palpable aura of **rage and destruction**. The handle is wrapped in **leather made from dragonhide**, and the head of the axe is adorned with **ancient runes** that pulse with dark energy. When wielded, **Rend** burns with intense, unnatural flames that sear both flesh and spirit.

**Varathor Bloodfury**, its previous owner, fed the axe with the souls of his fallen enemies, which gave it a **bloodthirsty will** of its own. It craves combat and bloodshed, driving its wielder to unleash fury on the battlefield.

### **Special Abilities**:

1. **Infernal Flames**:
    
    Whenever Rend strikes a target, it deals an additional **2d6 fire damage**. This fire cannot be extinguished by non-magical means and will continue to burn the target for **1d4 rounds** (dealing 1d6 fire damage each round) unless the flames are magically doused or the target takes an action to extinguish them.
    
2. **Searing Fury**:
    
    Once per day, the wielder can activate **Searing Fury**, igniting the axe in an intense flame that empowers its next attack. On a successful hit, the target must make a **DC 18 Constitution saving throw** or suffer **4d6 fire damage** and be knocked **prone**. If the attack kills the target, the axe absorbs a portion of the victim’s soul, restoring **1d6 hit points** to the wielder.
    
3. **Berserker’s Call**:
    
    The wielder can choose to tap into the **rage-infused magic** of the axe, going into a berserker state. For **1 minute**, the wielder gains **advantage on all attack rolls**, but takes **1d8 necrotic damage** at the start of each of their turns as the axe siphons life from its user. This ability can be used once per long rest.
    
4. **Dark Presence**:
    
    While attuned to Rend, the wielder’s presence becomes **unnerving** to those around them. Enemies within 30 feet of the wielder must make a **DC 16 Wisdom saving throw** or become **frightened** for 1 minute. They can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns.

### **Cursed Nature**:

While powerful, **Rend** carries a dark curse. Upon attuning to the axe, the wielder must make a **DC 17 Wisdom saving throw**. On a failure, the axe begins to influence their thoughts, pushing them toward **violent and reckless behavior**. This manifests in the following ways:

- **Bloodlust**: The wielder must make a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** every time they deal killing damage with Rend. On a failure, they enter a **frenzy** and must attack the nearest creature (friend or foe) until the frenzy subsides, lasting until the start of their next turn.
- **Soulbound**: Once attuned, the wielder cannot part with Rend unless they are subject to a **Remove Curse** spell or equivalent magical means. If Rend is forcibly taken from them, they will suffer from **nightmares** and **visions of death** until they either retrieve the axe or the curse is removed.

### **Backstory**:

Forged deep within the **Iron Wastes**, **Rend** was created as a weapon of conquest for Varathor Bloodfury, who used it to strike down both his enemies and allies without mercy. The dark flames that cover Rend were granted by a **fiendish pact** made between Varathor and a powerful demonic entity, fueling the axe with its unquenchable thirst for blood and chaos.

The axe became a symbol of fear, known to burn entire towns to the ground, its fire feeding off the screams of the dying. It was said that Rend whispered to Varathor in his darkest moments, urging him toward destruction, and after his defeat, it seeks a new wielder strong enough to carry its burden.

### **Value in the World**:

Rend is highly coveted by those who walk the path of darkness, particularly **warlocks**, **sorcerers**, and **barbarians** seeking a connection to forbidden powers. Its curse and bloodthirsty nature make it feared even among the most powerful warriors, but its power is undeniable. **Rumors** of Rend’s dark influence have spread, and several powerful factions—some even within the Oppressors—may seek to recover it after Varathor’s defeat.
