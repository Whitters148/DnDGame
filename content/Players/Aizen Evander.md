### **Race**: Human

### **Class**: Fighter

### **Background**: Outcast (modified from Folk Hero)

---

### **Backstory**:

Aizen Evander grew up as royalty in the vast empire to the west. His father, the King, ruled with an iron fist, and Aizen, as the illegitimate child of a forbidden affair, lived a life overshadowed by secrecy and danger. His mother, once a favored consort of the King, had fallen out of favor. At the age of 8, Aizen’s world was shattered when a man came to the castle, declaring a love affair with his mother that had lasted over the previous eight years.

The King, enraged by the betrayal, ordered both Aizen and his mother executed, believing Aizen to be the result of this illicit affair. But Aizen, even as a young child, was resourceful. As his mother was hanged in the castle courtyard, Aizen seized a dagger and, in a desperate act of survival, killed his father by slitting his throat.

Panicked and unable to trust anyone, Aizen fled the castle before the King’s guards could capture him. He ran for days, crossing deserts and forests with nothing to eat or wear. His flight through the wilds left him weak and exposed. At the brink of death, Aizen was attacked by a pack of bloodthirsty hyenas but was saved by two wandering rangers. They took him in and nursed him back to health, though the attack left him with numerous scars and missing the little finger on his left hand.

The rangers, suspecting his royal heritage but unsure of his full story, trained Aizen to defend himself. He spent the next twelve years learning the art of combat, mastering the claymore, and honing his senses to an inhuman level. His time with the rangers made him stronger, but the scars of his past continued to haunt him. The King had placed a bounty on his head, and the weight of his mother’s death and his father’s murder followed him like a shadow.

Now, Aizen roams the world as an outcast, a man without a home, living off his skills in battle. He knows he can never truly rest until the King’s final wish—that he be executed for regicide—is fulfilled, one way or another. His desire for justice, or perhaps revenge, drives him forward, though he struggles with the line between the two.

- **The Rangers Who Raised Me**: Aizen holds a deep respect for the two rangers who saved him from certain death. Though he left their village behind, they remain the only people he trusts.
- **The Village He Abandoned**: Aizen is haunted by the fact that he never returned to the village where he was raised. He knows he owes a debt to those who helped him, and one day, he hopes to repay it.

### **Appearance**:

Aizen Evander stands at 6 feet tall with a lean but athletic build, weighing 165 pounds. His skin is pale white, adding to his haunting appearance, and his striking blue eyes seem to pierce through whatever they rest on. His hair, a dark brown shade, is tied up neatly behind his head, a functional style that allows him to remain focused during combat. Despite his youth, the hardships of his past have left him with a worn, rugged look.

His body is marked with scars, reminders of the battles he has fought and the life he left behind. His left hand is missing its little finger, a constant reminder of the hyena attack he barely survived. Aizen typically wears practical armor—well-worn leather and metal—chosen for its balance of protection and mobility. His prized weapon, a longsword passed down through his family, rests at his side, ready for use at a moment’s notice.

### **Weapons and Abilities**:

- **Claymore Mastery**: Aizen wields a claymore with expert precision, using his speed and strength to overwhelm opponents.
- **Enhanced Senses**: His years of training with the rangers have given Aizen heightened senses, allowing him to track enemies and anticipate danger.
- **Survivalist**: Aizen’s time spent living in the wild has made him adept at survival. He can navigate harsh terrain, hunt, and forage for food, and endure difficult conditions.

### **Final Thoughts**:

Aizen Evander is a man shaped by loss and survival. His journey has taken him from the royal courts to the wilds, and though he has become a formidable warrior, the weight of his past continues to follow him. He seeks both justice and redemption, but the line between the two is often blurred. With his sharp instincts and relentless drive, Aizen’s path is filled with danger, but his unwavering resolve ensures he will stop at nothing to find peace—or vengeance.

  

  

Aizen’s story paints him more as a person on the run, exiled from his home and haunted by his past rather than celebrated for his actions. His escape from the King’s forces and the fact that he is hunted for the murder of his father gives him a more solitary and outcast-like persona. The **Outcast** background better fits a character who:

- Is mistrusted by the general population.
- Lives a life of secrecy and caution.
- Has unresolved guilt and emotional scars from their past.
