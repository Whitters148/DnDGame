---

### **Backstory**:

Quandavius Dingle Snoot III was once the pride of the small village of **Sharbood**, located just outside the bustling town of Newtonia. Born with a natural talent for both music and deception, Quandavius became the village bard, entertaining crowds with his wit, charm, and lute. His quick fingers plucked more than just strings—he often pocketed small trinkets and coins from his adoring audience, though he always made sure to leave enough behind so they wouldn’t notice.

For a while, life was good. The people loved him, and the taverns were always eager to have him play. He spent his nights surrounded by friends, wine, and his first love—a person whose memory now haunts him with every step. But everything changed the day the **King of Sharbood**, a paranoid and cruel ruler, framed Quandavius for the theft of the royal crown. Though innocent of this particular crime, Quandavius knew his reputation as a charming rogue preceded him, making it easy for the King to make him a scapegoat.

The King ordered his execution, but Quandavius, ever resourceful, managed to escape the dungeons. His freedom came at a terrible cost: the King, furious over Quandavius’ escape, took his vengeance out on the people closest to him. His friends, his family, and even his first love were all killed in his place.

With his heart shattered and his life in ruins, Quandavius vowed never to speak of his first love again, the pain too unbearable to share. To make matters worse, the King placed a bounty on Quandavius’ head, making him a wanted man across the region. Ever since that fateful day, Quandavius has been on the run, surviving through theft, deception, and his natural charisma.

Now, Quandavius trusts no one. His once-bright demeanor has been replaced by a calculating mind always planning for the worst. Though he continues to act the part of a carefree bard, behind every smile is a man who can no longer place his faith in another soul. He wanders from town to town, performing when necessary, stealing when possible, and always watching his back.

Though he still dreams of returning to Sharbood to reclaim his old life, Quandavius knows he can never return while the King lives. He bides his time, waiting for the day when the King will finally fall, and with it, the burden of his past.

### **Appearance**:

At 7 feet tall and weighing a lean 150 pounds, Quandavius Dingle Snoot III cuts an unusual figure, towering over most others with his gangly frame. His skin is pale, "pale as a ghost," making him stand out even more. His eyes glow an eerie amber, an almost unnatural hue that gives him a haunting, otherworldly appearance. His hair is rugged, dark, and often falls in messy strands over his face, adding to his roguish charm.

Despite his unusual height, Quandavius moves with the grace and fluidity of a natural performer, his every step calculated and precise. He wears simple clothing—often dark, muted tones to help him blend into shadows—yet always ensures his attire is just elegant enough to maintain his bardic image.

Though many are drawn to his glowing eyes and easy smile, there’s a palpable sense of danger that follows Quandavius wherever he goes. His charming façade masks a life of hardship, and the ever-present reminder of the bounty on his head keeps him constantly vigilant.
