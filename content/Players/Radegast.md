### **Background**: Soldier

---

### **Backstory**:

Radegast was born into a world where the line between humanity and the wild was often blurred. His village, nestled deep in the wilderness, had long been the subject of strange experiments by a reclusive order of druids. These druids believed that in order to protect nature, they needed to forge stronger warriors by blending the strengths of humans with the instincts of animals. Radegast's mother, a fierce warrior who had once led the village's defense, was one such experiment. As a result, Radegast was born part human, part wolf.

Growing up, Radegast struggled with his dual nature. The wolf inside him often clawed at his mind, seeking to dominate his human sensibilities. His upbringing in a military family, however, trained him to be disciplined and focused. He chose the path of the Paladin, hoping that the divine code and his strict sense of duty would give him the control and order he desperately craved.

Radegast served as a soldier in his kingdom’s army, where his enhanced senses, speed, and strength made him a formidable warrior. He quickly rose through the ranks, but his feral nature often unnerved his comrades. Though they respected his ability to lead on the battlefield, they were wary of his moments of solitude and the rage that simmered just beneath his stoic surface.

After years of loyal service, Radegast began to feel the pull of a greater calling. He left the military behind, taking up the oath of a Paladin, not only to defend the innocent but to seek control over the beast within. He now wanders the land, seeking both redemption and purpose, while hiding the constant battle between his humanity and the primal wolf that lives in his soul.

### **Personality Traits**:

- **Stoic and Reserved**: Radegast is a man of few words, preferring action over conversation. His demeanor is calm and collected, but it hides the storm of emotions he keeps buried deep within.
- **Easily Frustrated**: Though disciplined, Radegast has a short fuse when it comes to failure or indecision. His wolf instincts crave quick solutions and straightforward combat, while his human mind constantly forces him to hold back.

---

### **Ideals**:

- **Order in Chaos**: Radegast believes that the only way to maintain peace, both in the world and within himself, is through a strict adherence to rules and duty.
- **Control Over Instinct**: He constantly seeks to master his animal instincts, believing that only by controlling the beast inside him can he truly be human.

---

### **Bonds**:

- **The Wolf in the Woods**: Radegast believes that somewhere in the wild, the druids who created him still lurk, continuing their experiments. He feels a deep bond to these woods, drawn both by a need for answers and a desire to destroy those responsible for his curse.
- **The Brotherhood of the Pack**: Despite his solitary nature, Radegast cares deeply for those who fight alongside him. He sees them as part of his “pack” and will go to great lengths to protect them, even at the cost of his own life.
- **The Lost Paladin**: Radegast once fought alongside a fellow Paladin who succumbed to darkness. He is determined to find this fallen comrade, either to save him or, if necessary, end his suffering.

---

### **Flaws**:

- **Uncontrolled Rage**: There are times when the wolf’s rage gets the better of Radegast, and he becomes uncontrollably violent in battle, risking harm to allies and innocents.
- **Fear of Vulnerability**: Radegast fears showing weakness or vulnerability, and as a result, he rarely asks for help. His lone wolf mentality often isolates him from those who care about him.
- **Haunted by the Past**: Radegast cannot forget the deeds he performed as a soldier, especially the times when his instincts took control and led to unnecessary bloodshed. These memories torment him and fuel his desire for redemption.

### **Appearance**:

Radegast stands at 6'3" and weighs 300 pounds, his entire body covered in a thick layer of dark gray fur that extends seamlessly over his head, face, and body, akin to that of an animal. There is no distinct human hair—his head, face, and body are all coated in the same fur, giving him a fully lupine appearance. His elliptical, wolf-like eyes are a striking golden color, glowing faintly in dim light, and giving him a predatory presence that strikes both fear and awe in those who meet him.

His face, while retaining some human characteristics, is predominantly wolf-like. His strong jaw, sharp canines, and elongated nose blend perfectly with his furred face. The fur is slightly thicker around his neck and shoulders, providing him with a natural, rugged mane. His limbs are powerful and slightly elongated, ending in clawed hands and feet, making him a fearsome combatant both in hand-to-hand combat and in navigating the wilderness.

Radegast’s overall build is broad and muscular, the result of years spent honing his body for survival and battle. His armor is designed to accommodate his hybrid form, reinforced with tough leather and metal plating to provide protection without restricting his movements.

### **Weapons and Abilities**:

- **Martial Weapons**: Radegast wields a longsword, his favored weapon, though he is proficient with other martial arms. His strikes are quick and precise, enhanced by his heightened reflexes.
- **Simple Weapons**: He carries a dagger at his side, used more for utility than combat, but in dire situations, it can be as deadly as any sword.
- **Enhanced Senses**: Radegast’s hybrid nature grants him heightened senses, including sharp hearing and the ability to track by scent. These abilities are invaluable in both combat and exploration.
- **Divine Smite**: As a Paladin, Radegast channels divine energy to smite his enemies, but when his rage takes over, the radiant power is tinged with a dark, primal energy.

### **Final Thoughts**:

Radegast is a character torn between the disciplined path of the Paladin and the wild instincts of his wolf heritage. His journey is one of control—over his past, his emotions, and the beast within. He seeks redemption not just for his actions as a soldier, but for the very nature that defines him.
