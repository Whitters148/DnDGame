---

### **Backstory**:

Born in a remote village nestled in the foothills of a vast mountain range, **Thorne Blacksteel** grew up surrounded by wilderness and the hard, simple life of farming. As a child, he always felt that the village was too small for him and that there had to be more to life than the back-breaking labor of his family’s fields. By the age of 15, Thorne’s restlessness had grown too great to ignore, and he left the village behind in search of a greater purpose.

His early years on the road were filled with hardship. He traveled from town to town, offering his services as a hired sword but often found himself rejected. Thorne’s natural stubbornness earned him a reputation as difficult to work with, and his insistence on sticking to his principles, even in the face of adversity, led to many conflicts with those who sought to manipulate or control him. Despite his youth, he was forced to learn quickly how to survive in a world that cared little for an idealistic farm boy.

At the age of 20, after years of rejection and a growing bitterness toward the world, Thorne found his calling. He joined a mercenary crew that valued his stubborn nature and his growing prowess with weapons. His favorite was the greatsword, a weapon that suited his towering build and his desire to make an impact on the battlefield. Over the next two years, Thorne fought in skirmishes, guarded caravans, and handled disputes between rival lords and factions. He quickly developed a reputation as a fearsome fighter, but one who always lived by his own code of honor.

Thorne’s travels took him to lands where the Orcish language was common, and he picked up the ability to speak it fluently. This skill served him well when negotiating with rival mercenary groups or dealing with Orcish warbands, gaining him some respect even among those who viewed humans with disdain.

Despite his growing success, Thorne’s personality remained unyielding. His stubbornness—often seen as a flaw—became both his greatest strength and his biggest obstacle. He refused to back down from a fight or compromise his beliefs, even if it meant losing potential contracts. Thorne also developed a fascination with fire, his tendency to rely on it in battle earning him the nickname “**The Pyromaniac**” among his comrades. Whether he was torching enemy supplies or using controlled fire to force foes into disadvantageous positions, fire became one of his favorite tools of destruction.

Now, at 22, Thorne continues his journey as a seasoned mercenary, but deep down, he wonders whether his life of violence is all there is for him. Though he left his village to find a greater purpose, the question remains: has he truly found it, or is there something more waiting for him in the wider world?

### **Personality Traits**:

- **Stubborn to the Core**: Once Thorne sets his mind on something, nothing can dissuade him. His refusal to back down often leads him into dangerous situations, but his determination has also saved his life on more than one occasion.
- **Perceptive and Practical**: Despite his brash personality, Thorne is highly perceptive, always keeping a close eye on his surroundings. His experience in survival and perception allows him to identify threats and opportunities others might miss.

---

### **Ideals**:

- **Honor Among Mercenaries**: Thorne lives by a personal code of honor. He may be a mercenary, but he does not believe in betraying those who place their trust in him. His word is his bond, and he expects the same from others.
- **Strength through Self-Reliance**: Thorne believes that true strength comes from within. He has little respect for those who rely on others for their power, whether through magic, wealth, or deceit.

---

### **Bonds**:

- **The Mercenary Crew**: Thorne may have joined the mercenary life for the money, but his crew has become his makeshift family. He would fight to the death for any of them, knowing that they are the only ones who understand his life.
- **The Scars of His Past**: Thorne left his village behind, but the memory of his home—and the people he abandoned—still weighs on him. He refuses to talk about it, but part of him wonders if he will ever return to make peace with his past.

---

### **Flaws**:

- **Pyromaniac Tendencies**: Thorne has a dangerous fascination with fire, and his reliance on it in combat can sometimes lead to reckless decisions. His love for the chaos and destruction it brings often causes collateral damage.
- **Stubbornness**: While his stubbornness has kept him alive, it also blinds him to other possibilities. Thorne’s refusal to compromise often leads to unnecessary conflict, even when a peaceful solution might be available.

---

### **Appearance**:

Thorne Blacksteel stands at 6'1", a tall and muscular man with a strong, imposing build. His short, scruffy black hair and short beard give him a rugged, no-nonsense appearance. His skin is pale white, a stark contrast to the soot and grime that often covers him from battle or his pyromaniac exploits. His brown eyes are sharp and alert, constantly scanning his surroundings for potential threats or opportunities.

Though he is only 22, the years of travel and mercenary work have aged him beyond his years. Scars from past battles mar his arms and chest, though he wears them with pride as symbols of his resilience. Thorne typically wears well-worn studded leather armor that allows him mobility while providing decent protection. His armor is adorned with small, hand-crafted emblems representing the various mercenary companies he has worked with over the years.

### **Weapons and Abilities**:

- **Greatsword Mastery**: Thorne’s favored weapon is the greatsword, a massive blade that he wields with expert precision. His strength allows him to cleave through enemies with powerful, sweeping strikes.
- **Proficient with the Mace and Longbow**: While his greatsword is his weapon of choice, Thorne is also skilled with the mace for close-quarters combat and the longbow for ranged attacks.
- **Perceptive and Survivalist**: Thorne’s mercenary lifestyle has honed his survival instincts. His keen perception allows him to detect threats and hidden opportunities, while his survival skills help him navigate through dangerous environments.

---

### **Final Thoughts**:

Thorne Blacksteel is a man who values strength, loyalty, and personal honor. His stubborn nature makes him difficult to work with at times, but those who earn his trust find an unshakable ally in him. His love for fire, while dangerous, gives him a unique edge in battle, and his combat skills make him a formidable fighter. Thorne’s journey as a mercenary is far from over, and though he left his village to seek a greater purpose, he may one day return to confront the past he left behind.
