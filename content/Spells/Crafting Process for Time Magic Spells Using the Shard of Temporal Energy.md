### **1. Obtaining a Shard of Temporal Energy**

- **Location**: These rare shards are found deep within the **Temple of Lost Time**, guarded by **time phantoms** and **temporal traps**.
- **Nature of the Shard**: A **Shard of Temporal Energy** is a concentrated fragment of raw time magic, crackling with unstable power. It glows faintly, its energy pulsing like the ticking of a clock, and it distorts the area around it, creating faint echoes of the past and future.

**Risk**: Handling a **Shard of Temporal Energy** is dangerous. Players must make a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw** when they first obtain one. On a failure, they are subjected to 1d6 psychic damage as their mind is bombarded by fragments of time.

### **2. Attuning to the Shard**

- To craft spells from the shard, a player must attune to its power. This requires a ritual that takes 1 hour, in which the player must meditate on the nature of time and the flow of magic.
- The player makes a **DC 18 Arcana check**. On a success, the player becomes attuned to the shard, able to access its magical properties. On a failure, they experience a **Temporal Feedback**, aging 1d6 years instantly or having their next few hours pass in a blur.

**Consequences of Attunement**: After attuning, the player feels their perception of time shift. This could manifest in small narrative moments, such as seeing brief glimpses of the future or the past, or experiencing déjà vu.

### **3. Crafting the Time Spell**

- **Components**: In addition to the **Shard of Temporal Energy**, the player must gather other key ingredients:These components can be found in side quests or bartered for in specific magical shops.
    - **Silver Dust** from a naturally occurring time distortion (found near the Temple).
    - **Crystal of True Sight**, harvested from magical creatures with the ability to see into alternate timelines.
    - A **Fey Quartz Clock**, a timekeeping device crafted by fey artisans.

### **4. Timeforge Ritual**

- **Timeforge Ritual**: This special ritual requires a **magic user** (bard, sorcerer, wizard, or warlock) to manipulate the flow of time in a controlled environment, where they “weave” the spell into existence. The crafting takes place in a **Timeforge Chamber** within the Temple of Lost Time, an ancient room attuned to the flow of magic.
- The ritual takes **8 hours** to complete and requires the expenditure of **500 gold worth of materials** (for the additional components and focus items). If the player does not have access to the **Timeforge Chamber**, they may attempt the crafting elsewhere, but the **DCs** for the process increase by **+2** due to the instability of time magic outside of its natural home.

### **5. Crafting Check**

- **Arcana DC**: The player makes a **DC 20 Arcana check** to successfully craft the spell. On a success, the spell is imprinted into the shard, and the player now possesses it as part of their spellbook or spell repertoire.
    - **Success**: The spell is crafted, and the player can now cast it using the shard as a magical focus or component.
    - **Failure**: The shard becomes unstable, and the player takes **4d6 psychic damage** as the temporal energy backfires. The shard can still be used again, but the player must attempt the ritual on another day.

### **6. Using the Crafted Spell**

- Once a spell has been crafted using the **Shard of Temporal Energy**, it can be cast like any other spell. However, to tap into its full potential, the caster must continue to use the **Shard** as a focus, meaning the shard is consumed for one-time use or remains as an attunement item for the player (depending on the strength of the spell crafted).

**Special Rules for Time Spells**:

1. **Temporal Fluctuations**: Time magic is unstable. Each time a time-based spell is cast, there is a 10% chance that the caster is subject to a random temporal fluctuation:
    - The caster might **age** or **de-age** by 1d4 years.
    - The caster experiences **visions** of the past or future, giving them advantage/disadvantage on their next roll.
    - The caster is **briefly frozen in time**, losing 1 action.
2. **Shard Limitation**: A **Shard of Temporal Energy** can only be used to craft one spell at a time. Once a spell is crafted, the shard can either be consumed (for a one-time powerful effect) or recharged in the **Temple of Lost Time**.

### **Crafting Example: Temporal Surge**

**Step 1**: The player has obtained the **Shard of Temporal Energy** from the **Temple of Lost Time** and has attuned to it.  
  
**Step 2**: The player gathers the additional components: **Silver Dust**, **Crystal of True Sight**, and a **Fey Quartz Clock**.  
  
**Step 3**: The player performs the **Timeforge Ritual** in the Temple, spending 8 hours and 500 gold worth of materials.  
  
**Step 4**: The player makes a **DC 20 Arcana check** and succeeds, imbuing the shard with the **Temporal Surge** spell.  
  
**Step 5**: The player can now cast **Temporal Surge** using the shard as a focus. The spell can be re-cast later by maintaining attunement to the shard.
