- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 round

**Description**:  
You briefly step out of the normal flow of time, gaining an extra action on your turn. For the duration of this spell, you can make an additional attack, move up to your full speed again, or cast a cantrip as part of your extra action.

- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

**Description**:  
You reverse time for a brief moment, undoing the damage or effects that have just occurred. When a creature you can see within 60 feet takes damage, you can roll back time, negating the damage and any conditions imposed by the attack or spell.  

**Consequences**: Each time you cast this spell, you must make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw**. On a failure, you are stunned for 1 round as your mind struggles to process the time reversal.

- **Components**: V, S, M (a small silver hourglass worth at least 100 gp)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Description**:  
You manipulate the flow of time around a creature, speeding up their movements. Choose one willing creature within range. Until the spell ends, that creatureâ€™s speed is doubled, they gain an additional action on each of their turns (this action can be used to make one weapon attack, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object), and they have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.  

**Consequences**: When the spell ends, the target must make a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw**. On a failure, they become **slowed** for 1 minute, only able to move at half speed and take one action or bonus action per turn.

- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: 1d4+1 turns (see below)

**Description**:  
You briefly halt the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4+1 turns in a row. During these turns, you can move and take actions as normal. This spell ends if one of your actions directly affects another creature or an object being worn or carried by someone else.  

**Consequences**: After casting **Time Stop**, you must make a **DC 20 Wisdom saving throw**. On a failure, you take 4d10 psychic damage as the strain of manipulating time ravages your mind.

- **Components**: V, S, M (a silver pocket watch)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Description**:  
You warp the time around a creature, causing them to flicker between the present and the past. Choose one creature within range. That creature must make a  
**Wisdom saving throw**. On a failed save, they become **displaced** in time. They have disadvantage on attack rolls, and attack rolls against them have advantage. Each round, the creature must roll a d6. On a roll of 1 or 2, they are not present in the current round and cannot take any actions or reactions.

**Description**:  
You pull yourself slightly out of sync with time, creating a brief pocket of temporal displacement that deflects incoming attacks. Until the start of your next turn, you have  
**resistance to all damage**, and attack rolls against you are made with **disadvantage**.

**Consequences**: After the spell ends, you must make a **DC 14 Constitution saving throw** or take 2d6 necrotic damage as the strain of the time shift weakens your body.

- **Duration**: Instantaneous

**Description**:  
You release the sands of time, slowing or aging creatures in an area. Choose a point within range. All creatures within a 30-foot radius must make a  
**Constitution saving throw**. On a failed save, the creatures are slowed for 1 minute (as per the **Slow** spell). Additionally, one creature of your choice that fails the saving throw ages 1d10 years instantly.

**Dexterity saving throw** or be stunned as their timeline fractures. Each round, they must repeat the saving throw. If they fail three times, they are permanently frozen in time until a **Wish** or similar magic releases them. Each creature that starts its turn in the area takes 4d6 psychic damage from the time distortion.

**Consequences**: After casting **Time Fracture**, you must make a **DC 19 Intelligence saving throw**. On a failure, you suffer from temporal sickness, reducing your speed by half and giving you disadvantage on all saving throws for the next hour.
