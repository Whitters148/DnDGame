**Special Abilities**:

- **Graveborn Strike**: When you deal damage with Gravebreaker, you can choose to channel the power of death into your attack. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of your next turn. This ability can only be used once per short rest.

**Gravebreaker** would require **attunement** to a character with one of the following:

- **Strength 16 or higher**: Given the heavy and powerful nature of the weapon, the wielder must have significant physical strength to wield it properly.
- **A connection to necrotic magic or death magic**: The character must be a spellcaster with access to necromantic magic or have a strong connection to death-related abilities (e.g., classes like Cleric [Grave Domain], Warlock [Undying Patron], or a Death Knight).

**Lore**:  
"Forged deep within the shadowed depths of the Abyss, Gravebreaker was once wielded by an ancient champion of death. Its crushing weight and necrotic energy are feared among the living and revered by those who dwell in the dark. The souls it has claimed linger in its presence, waiting for the chance to rise again."
