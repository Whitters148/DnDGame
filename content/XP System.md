### Milestone System Framework:

1. **Major Milestones:** These represent the most important turning points in your story. These can include defeating major enemies, completing a significant story arc, or retrieving a powerful artifact.
    
    **Examples:**
    
    - **Defeating a Major Boss:** Kaida Shadowsong, Seraphis Blackflame, etc.
    - **Claiming an Artifact:** Acquiring a piece of powerful equipment or a relic tied to the story, such as ??? or ???
    - **Story Completion:** Finishing an entire act or major segment of the story (e.g., reaching the Abyssal Gate, securing Falconstone as a stronghold).
    - **Player-Driven Accomplishments:** The party resolves a significant political or social conflict, such as gaining allies in a faction, forging an alliance or joining one, or making a difficult moral choice.
    
    **Level Up:** After achieving 1-2 major milestones, players level up.
    
2. **Minor Milestones:** These are still important moments in the campaign but less significant than the major milestones. They are moments of progress within an arc or adventure, where the players advance the story or their personal objectives.
    
    **Examples:**
    
    - **Defeating a Minor Boss:** Lesser enemies that aren't as powerful as generals but still a hard fight, or a big encounter consisting of many enemies
    - **Side Quests:** Successfully completing a side quest, like helping Vespera Nightshade or Zarash Bloodtusk with their personal stories.
    - **Major Social Achievements:** Convincing a key NPC to join your cause (like Seraphina), or resolving a key narrative decision peacefully.
    - **Discovering Key Lore or Locations:** Finding a hidden temple, revealing a crucial piece of history, or exploring a dangerous area like the Glacial Crypt.
    
    **Level Up:** After 3-4 minor milestones, players level up.
    
3. **Personal Growth Milestones:** These are tied to a characterâ€™s personal development, backstory, or goals. Reward players for completing key steps in their individual arcs or making significant personal decisions.
    
    **Examples:**
    
    - **Backstory Resolution:** A player confronts a key figure from their past, such as a mentor or rival.
    - **Personal Achievement:** A character learns a new technique, gains a powerful magic item, or discovers a hidden facet of their abilities (like a class upgrade or subclass).
    - **Relationship Development:** Building a strong bond with an NPC, such as starting a romance (with Vespera Nightshade, for example), or making a long-lasting friendship with another.
    
    **Level Up:** When 2-3 personal growth milestones are achieved for each character, the whole party can level up.
    
4. **World-Shifting Events:** These milestones occur when the party's actions have a significant impact on the game world. These tend to happen less frequently but mark important points in the campaign.
    
    **Examples:**
    
    - **Saving or Destroying a Town:** The players liberate or sacrifice a place like Gloomwatch or Frostgale.
    - **Influencing a Major Faction:** Players align themselves with the Resistance, the Oppressors, or neutral factions and shift the balance of power in their favor. Done either through politics, force, moving through ranks
    - **Unleashing/Sealing a Major Force:** Players release or contain powerful beings or magic, like an ancient dragon, a primordial force, or a cursed artifact.
    
    **Level Up:** These events often trigger immediate level-ups due to their profound impact on the narrative and game world.
